The Kubeflow 1.4 release lays several important building blocks for the use of advanced metadata workflows. A quick summary of
1.4’s top deliveries includes:

- Advanced metadata workflows with improved metric visualization and pipeline
  step [caching](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/caching-v2/)
  in Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) via the KFP Software Development Kit (SDK)
- A new KFServing
  [model user interface](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/kfserving/webapp/)
  that displays ML model status, configuration, yaml, logs, and metrics 
- New [Optuna](https://github.com/optuna/optuna) Suggestion Service with
  multivariate TPE algorithm and Sobol’s
  [Quasirandom](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/pull/1523) Sequence support
  for hyperparameter tuning
- A new, unified training operator that supports all deep learning frameworks
  with a Python SDK, enhanced monitoring and advanced scheduling support

Kubeflow 1.4 enables the use of metadata in advanced machine learning (ML) workflows, especially
in the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK. With the Pipelines SDK and its new
[V2-compatible mode](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/sdk/v2/v2-compatibility/),
users can create advanced ML pipelines with Python functions that use the [MLMD](https://github.com/google/ml-metadata) as
input/output arguments. This simplifies
[metrics visualization](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/sdk/output-viewer/#v2-sdk-use-sdk-visualization-apis). 

Another enhancement to Pipelines is the option to use the
[Emissary executor](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/installation/choose-executor/)
for non-Docker Kubernetes container runtime requirements. In addition, 1.4 can 
support metadata-based workflows to streamline the creation of TensorBoard 
visualizations and to serve ML models.

## Core improvements to code, process, and documentation

For the Kubeflow Working Groups, 1.4 was primarily a maintenance release, 
which enabled the Community to concentrate on core improvements to code, 
process, and documentation. In the
[2021 Kubeflow User Survey](https://blog.kubeflow.org/kubeflow-continues-to-move-to-production),
users requested documentation improvements (please see the figure below). The
Kubeflow 1.4 release cycle included the 1.4 Docs Sprint that generated nearly
fifty (50) PRs. These PRs were tracked in this
[issue](https://github.com/kubeflow/website/issues/2879) and this
[Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/kubeflow/projects/46) board, and we encourage
more users to contribute by reading and improving the Kubeflow documentation.

The 1.4 release improvements simplify future feature development by reducing
redundant code, increasing CI/CD, and automating testing. An important delivery
was the new Unified Training Operator for Tensorflow, PyTorch, MXNet, and
XGBoost [PR#1302](https://github.com/kubeflow/tf-operator/pull/1302). 1.4 also
initiated the Community’s adoption of a defined release process in its new
Kubeflow [Release Handbook](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/pull/1907).
The Handbook defines the stages of the release and contributors’ roles, which
has helped to improve responsibilities and quality.

## Simplified installation

As shown in the Kubeflow User Survey (see the figure above), users have also
asked for installation improvements. In Kubeflow 1.3, the Community refactored
the Kubeflow deployment pattern to use manifests files (in yaml or json), which
are stored in Git repositories, and then deployed using the Kustomize
installation tool. This flexible installation pattern simplifies customization
by overlaying manifests. This pattern is now being exploited in 1.4.

In 1.4, the Community provides an upstream set of base manifests in the
Kubeflow manifest repo. Third parties have built custom installation guides
or distributions with overlays that extend the base manifests. In 1.4, the
third party overlays were removed from the Kubeflow
[manifest repo](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests) and moved to the
repository of their choosing. This pattern provides third parties more
flexibility to upgrade and document their overlays. You can see a full set of
installation guides and distributions
[here](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/installing-kubeflow/).    

In addition, on-prem Kubeflow users can use the base installation manifests
which utilize open source solutions like [Istio](https://istio.io/),
[Dex](https://dexidp.io/), and
[AuthService](https://github.com/arrikto/oidc-authservice) for authentication.
The Community and the Manifests Working Group are actively working to provide
extra overlays and patches to accommodate more advanced use cases and
installations. For example, we recently
[configured](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/pull/2048) Knative to work
with the AuthService and Dex.

## Dependencies, change logs, tracking issues and roadmaps

Kubeflow has many software dependencies. In 1.4, the top dependencies used in
testing are defined below:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Kubeflow Dependency</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Version</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Kubernetes</td>
    <td>1.19.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Istio</td>
    <td>1.9.6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Knative</td>
    <td>0.22.1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Kustomize</td>
    <td>3.2.0</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This chart provides links to important details from the Working Groups,
including their 1.4 tracking issues, change logs, and roadmaps. Please 
note that the Working Groups use version numbers that are specific to 
their project. As a result, many Kubeflow components, which have been 
incorporated and tested in Kubeflow 1.4, may have a different version 
number than 1.4.
