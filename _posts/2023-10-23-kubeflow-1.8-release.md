### Training Operator

Many model developers are experiencing challenges with GPU utilization, especially with large language models. The new training operator functionality provides efficient configuration, utilization and scaling for training. v1.8 improves support for gang schedulers such as volcano, scheduler-plugins and koord-schedule ([#1747](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/pull/1747)).  Additionally the implementation of suspend semantics allows the external controller to delete or not create Pods depending on the state of the flag ([#1859](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/pull/1859)). V1.8 also includes workflow updates and bug fixes that make model training more straightforward to use.  A selection of these features and bug fixes include:



* Make scheduler-plugins the default gang scheduler. ([#1747](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/pull/1747))
* Auto-generate RBAC manifests by the controller-gen ([#1815](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/pull/1815))
* Set correct env variables for PytorchJob to support torchrun, allowing to support different distributed training launch methods ([#1840](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/pull/1840)) 
* Add default Intel MPI env variables to MPIJob ([#1804](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/pull/1804))
* Fully consolidate tfjob-operator to training-operator ([#1850](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/pull/1850))

More information on the release can be found in the [release notes](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/releases/)


### KServe

Kubeflow v1.8 introduces KServe 0.11. In this release, we've introduced Large Language Model (LLM) runtimes, made enhancements to the KServe control plane, and updated the Python SDK with revised support for the Open Inference Protocol, as well as improved dependency management using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/). A selection of these features and bug fixes include:

* TorchServe 0.8.0 for LLM support ([#2980](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/pull/2980))
* Implement v2/open inference endpoints for kserve python runtimes ([2655](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/pull/2655))
* Adding an end-to-end example for deploying a large language model on KServe ([2836](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/pull/2836))

More information on the KServe 0.11 release can be found in the [release notes](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/releases/tag/v0.11.0/)

### Simplifying Storage for ML Workflows

Kubeflow’s web apps enhancements expose valuable information to data scientists, which simplifies advanced workflows.  For example, Kubernetes storage management, especially for persistent volumes, is critical for rapid data science iteration but can require complex, manual configuration.  The newly introduced PVC Viewer makes storage management easy for end users and eliminates the need to learn low-level CLI commands.    Users can click and drag to add/remove files and file directories from persistent volumes.  The volumes can easily be attached to MLOps objects, like notebooks, which makes experimenting with different data sets faster.

### Support for ARM Machines 

Kubeflow 1.8 brings forward a significant upgrade [(#7343)](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/7342) by officially introducing support for ARM architectures. This move ensures that developers can leverage Kubeflow's powerful machine learning capabilities on a wider variety of devices and platforms, including the Apple Silicon and a multitude of IoT devices. This expansion highlights Kubeflow's adaptability, ensuring seamless machine learning workflows across various hardware architectures.


### Security - Rootless Kubeflow Updates and Fixes

In our ongoing commitment to bolstering security, version 1.8 brings both vital security fixes and innovative features. A notable endeavor by the Security Team has been the development of features that lay the groundwork for a [rootless Kubeflow #2455](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/pull/2455) in the future. v1.8 offers users the flexibility to run Kubeflow either with the optional istio-cni or without it. A selection of these features and bug fixes include:

* Fix performance issue within a mysql request that could cause a denial of service ([#9680](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/pull/9680))
* Fix issue on which Profile controller and KFAM allow unauthenticated in-cluster traffic([#7032](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/7032))
* Adding oauth2-proxy as optional alternative to oidc-authservice ([#2409](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/pull/2409))


Future versions will continue to refine this rootless functionality, along with plans to make istio-cni the default option along with istio ambient mesh and incorporating [Pod Security Standards](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/7325).

### Notebooks

Kubeflow Notebook 1.8 brings many enhancements to the [notebook container images](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/notebooks/container-images/).

This chart shows how the official images are now related to each other

![Kubeflow notebook images](/images/2023-10-23-kubeflow-1.8-release/images_diagram.png)

Of special note is that all notebook images (except the CUDA ones) are now built for both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures [(#7357)](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/7357).
Additionally, it is now much easier to build custom images by running `make docker-build-dep` from within the image's folder.
We have also updated to the following package versions:
- Python 3.11.6
- JupyterLab 3.6.6
- Tensorflow 2.13.0 and CUDA 11.8 (for Tensoflow CUDA images)
- PyTorch 2.1.0 and CUDA 12.1 (for PyTorch CUDA images)
