# Kubeflow v1.8 Debuts: Official Support for Pipelines v2, Advanced Security, expanded support in architectures and Storage Exploration 


## Kubeflow v1.8’s powerful Python SDKs simplify Kubernetes-native MLOps, reducing manual yaml configuration

Kubeflow v1.8 uniquely delivers Kubernetes-native MLOps via simplified pythonic based workflows, which means less manual yaml, docker and Kubernetes CLI operations.  The new workflows simplify ML pipelines building, hyper parameter tuning, distributed model training with GPUs as well as model serving. In addition, many underlying dependencies e.g. Kubernetes, Tensorflow, PyTorch, have been updated, which has improved Kubeflow’s security profile and reduces our enterprise users’ integration work.  Kubeflow 1.8 has also added ARM processor support, which addresses a significant portion of the Chinese server market, and also helps adoption by Apple MacBook ARM users.

In Kubeflow v1.8,  ML pipelines are now constructed as modular components, enabling easily chainable and reusable ML workflows. v1.8 also delivers model (training) parallelism for large language models and introduces the PVC Viewer for simplified persistent storage management, eliminating the need for Kubernetes CLI storage commands.  The new Katib SDK provides a powerful python based solution that reduces manual configuration and simplifies the delivery of your tuned model.

* Support for using [pipelines as components](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v2/pipelines/pipeline-basics/#pipelines-as-components) (pipeline in pipeline)
* Various additional [configurations for tasks](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v2/pipelines/pipeline-basics/#task-configurations)
* Compilation to an Argo-independent [pipeline definition](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v2/compile-a-pipeline/#ir-yaml) that enables pipelines to be compiled once and run anywhere
* An improved [KFP CLI](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v2/cli/)
* Refreshed [user documentation](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v2/) and [reference documentation](https://kubeflow-pipelines.readthedocs.io/en/sdk-2.0.0/)

This pipeline release is focused on cross-platform portability, features such as reading and writing to a Kubernetes PVC has been moved into the extension package [kfp-kubernetes](https://pypi.org/project/kfp-kubernetes/), more information can be found at the [platform specific features](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v2/platform-specific-features/) page on the Kubeflow Website.


## Katib:

The updated Katib pythonic SDK in Kubeflow v1.8 helps developers to improve model quality by simplifying the configuration and tracking of model and environmental parameters.  In this release we are happy to announce new KatibConfig API [(#2176)](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/pull/2176) along with multiple commits improving the experience in the UI and Bug Fixes in the SDK.  A selection of these features and bug fixes include:



* Upgrade Tensorflow version to v2.13.0 ([#2216](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/pull/2216))
* Start waiting for certs to be ready before sending data to the channel ([#2215](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/pull/2215))
* Remove a katib-webhook-cert Secret from components [(#2214](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/pull/2214))


## Training Operator:

Many model developers are experiencing challenges with GPU utilization, especially with large language models. The new training operator functionality provides efficient configuration, utilization and scaling for training. v1.8 improves support for gang schedulers such as volcano, scheduler-plugins and koord-schedule ([#1747](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/pull/1747)).  Additionally the implementation of suspend semantics allows the external controller to delete or not create Pods depending on the state of the flag ([#1859](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/pull/1859)). V1.8 also includes workflow updates and bug fixes that make model training more straightforward to use.  A selection of these features and bug fixes include:



* Make scheduler-plugins the default gang scheduler. ([#1747](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/pull/1747))
* Auto-generate RBAC manifests by the controller-gen ([#1815](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/pull/1815))
* Set correct env variables for PytorchJob to support torchrun, allowing to support different distributed training launch methods ([#1840](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/pull/1840)) 
* Add default Intel MPI env variables to MPIJob ([#1804](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/pull/1804))
* Fully consolidate tfjob-operator to training-operator ([#1850](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/pull/1850))


## Kserve

TBD from kserve team, [https://github.com/kserve/kserve/releases/tag/v0.11.0/](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/releases/tag/v0.11.0/)


### Simplifying Storage for ML Workflows

Kubeflow’s web apps enhancements expose valuable information to data scientists, which simplifies advanced workflows.  For example, Kubernetes storage management, especially for persistent volumes, is critical for rapid data science iteration but can require complex, manual configuration.  The newly introduced PVC Viewer makes storage management easy for end users and eliminates the need to learn low-level CLI commands.    Users can click and drag to add/remove files and file directories from president volumes.  The volumes can easily be attached to MLOps objects, like notebooks, which makes experimenting with different data sets faster.

### Support for ARM Machines 


Kubeflow 1.8 brings forward a significant upgrade [(#7343)](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/7342) by officially introducing support for ARM architectures. This move ensures that developers can leverage Kubeflow's powerful machine learning capabilities on a wider variety of devices and platforms, including the likes of Apple Silicon and a multitude of IoT devices. This expansion highlights Kubeflow's adaptability, ensuring seamless machine learning workflows across various hardware architectures.


### Security - Rootless Kubeflow and Istio CNI

In our efforts to enhance security within the project, version 1.8 continues to work in rootless kubeflow. Proposed and developed by Julius von Kohout [(#2455)](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/pull/2455), v.1.8 offers the flexibility to run kubeflow either with or without the optional istio-cni. Additionally, it incorporates robust PodSecurityPolicies that ensure default security measures when operating within a Kubernetes cluster. Notably, using istio-cni eliminates the need for a sidecar with root-level privileges Future versions will continue to refine this functionality, with plans to make istio-cni the default option. This will further reduce kubeflow's vulnerability to CVEs


### Platform dependencies, breaking changes, add-ons

Kubeflow 1.8 includes hundreds of commits. The Kubeflow release process includes several rounds of testing by the Kubeflow working groups and Kubeflow distributions. Kubeflow’s configuration options provide a high degree of flexibility. After considering all of the testing options, the 1.8 Release Team narrowed the critical dependencies for consistent testing and documentation to the following.
