**_Quotes:_**

"Excited to start my two-year term on the Kubeflow Steering Committee on behalf of Red Hat! Thanks to everyone who's supported along the way! Congratulations to all the new committee members! Johnu, Andrey, and I have been collaborating for years on various Kubeflow subprojects and I look forward to working with them more closely. Together with the Kubeflow community, CNCF ecosystem projects, supporting organizations, and partners, I am confident that we will steer the project towards a successful CNCF journey." - _Yuan (Terry) Tang (Red Hat) \

_"I am thrilled to join the Kubeflow Steering Committee for the two-year term. Being an active member of this community for almost six years, it was great to see how the project evolves towards open governance and widespread user adoption. Thanks to everyone for your support, collaboration, and contributions throughout these years. Kubeflow stands as the foundational framework to run AI/ML workloads on Kubernetes. It bridges ML, Big Data, and Cloud Native ecosystems to facilitate a new generation of AI applications. Kubeflow components empower users at every stage of ML lifecycle from model development and training to fine-tuning and deployment. I am excited about the future of CNCF and Kubeflow together, to build an open CloudNative AI/ML platform accessible to everyone." - _Andrey Velichkevich (Apple)_

“I am really excited to join the first Kubeflow Steering Committee formed post CNCF incubation. Kubeflow is one of the most popular enterprise-ready MLOps platforms used in production at various companies. It has become the de facto platform to run complex ML pipelines, managing model lifecycles on a large scale. Having been part of Kubeflow leadership since its inception, it is delightful to see its growing ecosystem proving its relevance in the current times. Thanks to the entire Kubeflow user and developer community, who have immensely contributed to its success over the years. I am excited to drive the future of this vibrant community and look forward to the next phase of the Kubeflow journey in the CNCF ecosystem.”  -_ Johnu George (Nutanix)_
