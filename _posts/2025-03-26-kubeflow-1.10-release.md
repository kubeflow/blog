Kubeflow 1.10.0 delivers essential updates that enhance the flexibility, efficiency, and scalability of machine learning
workflows. The new features span across several components, improving both user experience and system performance.

## Benefits to the ecosystem

* Migration to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr) as default container registry for (most) images

## Highlight features

* Trainer 2.0
* Model Registry UI
* Spark Operator as a core Kubeflow component
* Kubernetes and container security (CISO compatibility)
* LLM hyper parameter tuning

The upcoming Kubeflow release (v1.10) is packed with exciting new features and enhancements designed to streamline your
machine learning workflows and improve security. Key highlights include the introduction of a Model Registry UI, the new
Kubeflow Trainer 2.0, and the integration of the Spark Operator as a core Kubeflow component. This release also places a
strong emphasis on Kubernetes and container security, addressing critical CISO compatibility requirements.

Beyond these additions, Kubeflow v1.10 delivers significant improvements across the platform. Pipelines gain flexibility
with loop parallelism, enabling more dynamic and efficient workflows. Katib expands its hyperparameter optimization
capabilities with new parameter distributions and a high-level API tailored for fine-tuning large language models
(LLMs). Model Registry provides deeper integrations with KServe, while KServe itself brings a new Python SDK, OCI
storage for models, and model caching, boosting model deployment speed and reliability. Finally, the Spark operator
enhancements deliver secure and scalable cluster management with new security contexts and rootless Istio-CNI
integrations.

## Pipelines

Kubeflow Pipelines 2.4.1 introduces several enhancements to improve the flexibility and control of your machine learning
workflows.

### Support for Placeholders in Resource Limits

Kubeflow Pipelines 2.4.1 introduces support for [placeholders in resource limits](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/pull/11501),
enhancing flexibility in pipeline execution.This update allows users to define dynamic resource limits using
parameterized values, enabling more adaptable and reusable pipeline definitions.

### Support for Loop Parallelism

Kubeflow Pipelines 2.4.1 introduces a new [Parallelism Limit for `ParallelFor` tasks](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/issues/8718),
giving users the ability to run massively parallel inference pipelines, with more control over parallel execution in
their workflows. This feature allows users to specify the maximum number of parallel iterations, preventing resource
overutilization and improving system stability.

### Implement SubDAG Output Resolution

Kubeflow 1.10 ensures that [pipelines using nested DAGs](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/pull/11196) work
correctly and reliably when treated as components. Outputs from deeply nested DAGs will now resolve properly, avoiding
broken dependencies.

## Model Registry

Model Registry introduces a new user interface and enhanced model management capabilities.

### Model Registry UI

The new Kubeflow [Model Registry UI](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/model-registry/getting-started/#using-the-model-registry-ui)
provides a user-friendly web interface for managing machine learning models within the Kubeflow platform. It centralizes
model metadata, version tracking, and artifact management, streamlining MLOps workflows.

Key features include:

* Easy model registration with custom metadata
* Comprehensive model management with filtering and sorting
* Archiving capabilities
* Version control
* Metadata editing

![Model Registry UI](../images/2025-03-26-kubeflow-1.10-release/model-registry-ui.png)

The UI interacts with the Model Registry's REST API, making it accessible to users of all technical backgrounds and
enhancing collaboration across data science, ML engineering, and MLOps teams.

To get started with the Model Registry UI, which is currently in Alpha, you can follow the instructions
[here](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/model-registry/installation/#installing-on-kubeflow-platform).

### Custom Storage Initializer

The Model Registry Custom Storage Initializer (CSI) is a custom implementation of the KServe ClusterStorageContainer.
This feature allows users to utilize Model Registry metadata to download and deploy models efficiently. With the newest
release of the Model Registry, it is now possible to install and use the Custom Storage Initializer (CSI).

You can find detailed installation instructions and a small example in the "Getting Started" section of the Model
Registry component on the Kubeflow website.

For additional information and future developments towards better integration with KServe, you can refer to the slides
[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wprxN0n23EMkPRX_PaZZcIzZbn_i8Sh_).

## Training Operator (Trainer) & Katib

Kubeflow 1.10 enhances the Training Operator and Katib, providing new tools and APIs for hyperparameter optimization,
particularly for large language models.

### Hyperparameter Optimization API for LLMs

Kubeflow 1.10 introduces a new high-level [API for hyperparameter tuning](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/issues/2339),
streamlining LLMOps workflows in Kubernetes. This API integrates Katib and the Training Operator to automate
hyperparameter optimization, reducing manual effort for data scientists fine-tuning large language models.

### Support for Various Parameter Distributions

Kubeflow 1.10 enhances Katib’s hyperparameter optimization capabilities by introducing
[support for multiple probability distributions](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/issues/2374). Previously limited to
uniform distributions, Katib now supports log-uniform, normal, and log-normal distributions, providing data scientists
with greater flexibility in tuning hyperparameters. This is particularly useful for parameters like learning rates,
which benefit from log-uniform sampling, or values expected to vary around a mean, suited for normal distributions.

### Push-Based Metrics Collection

Katib now allows users to push metrics to Katib DB directly.The new push-based design provides administrative and
performanace improvements to the existing pull based design.

## Dashboard & Notebooks

* Prometheus Metrics Enhancement: Notebooks and CRUD backends now expose Prometheus metrics for improved observability.
* OAuth2-Proxy Logout Fix: Resolving logout issues for proper user logout.
* Improved Notebook Creation Error Messages: Providing more specific error messages for resource constraint failures.
* Update all Notebook / Workspace images and migrate most images to GHCR.
* For more information, please consult the [release notes](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/releases/tag/v1.10.0).

Kubeflow 1.10 improves the observability and usability of Notebooks, while providing updated
[default images](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/7687).

### Prometheus Metrics for Notebooks

Both the Notebooks component and CRUD backends now feature Prometheus metrics. Notebooks expose custom metrics using the
prom-client library, and CRUD backends utilize the prometheus_flask_exporter library. This ensures consistent metrics
integration across all backend services.

### More Descriptive Error Messages

Error messages for notebook creation failures due to resource constraints are now more descriptive. Users can quickly
identify issues such as insufficient resources.

## KServe

KServe v0.14.1 introduces several essential features that enhance its capabilities for deploying and managing machine
learning models.

### New Python SDK

The release includes a new Python SDK with both REST and GRPC inference clients, offering asynchronous support and the
ability to handle tensor data in binary format.

### OCI Storage for Models

OCI storage for models has also been promoted to a stable feature, with improvements to stability by configuring OCI
models as init containers.

### Model Cache Feature

Additionally, the introduction of the Model Cache feature leverages local node storage to reduce model load times,
especially for large models, enhancing scalability.

### Hugging Face Integration

KServe v0.14.1 further expands integration with Hugging Face, enabling direct model deployment from the Hugbing Face hub
via a new `hf://` URI schema.
