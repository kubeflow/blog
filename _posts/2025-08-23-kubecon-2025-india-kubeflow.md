## Introduction

We (@jaiakash and @yashpal2104) got the chance to attend KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Hyderabad, India 2025, attending talks and networking with people and developers in cloud native community and learning about the latest updates in the cloud-native machine learning ecosystem. We also volunteered to help with the KubeFlow booth, engaging with the community and answering the audience questions. With the help of @johnugeorge the

## KubeFlow Booth Highlights

- **Info & Updates:**  
  - Demonstrations of new KubeFlow features and integrations.
  - Discussions on real-world use cases and deployment strategies.
  - Insights into the growing adoption of KubeFlow in India.
  - People wanting to learn more about how to contribute to Kubeflow and incorporate it into their workflows and use it as a tool.
  - Several companies expressed interest in adopting projects like Kubeflow.


- **Audience Questions:**  
  - How does KubeFlow simplify ML workflows on Kubernetes?
  - What are the best practices for scaling ML workloads?
  - How does KubeFlow integrate with other cloud-native tools?
  - What are the security considerations for running ML pipelines?
  - How mature is Kubeflow today, and how well does it align with the workflows of different ML roles—for example, data scientists or teams looking to run and scale LLMs on Kubernetes?
  - What does the roadmap for Kubeflow look like, and how can the community continue to engage and shape its development?
  - Why has Kubeflow chosen to integrate with ArgoCD rather than Tekton CD—a question that even came up from a maintainer of the Tekton project?
  - How can Kubeflow help optimize costs when working with LLMs, especially in terms of minimizing GPU usage to stay within quota limits while still delivering performance?
  - What is the timeline of graduation for Kubeflow?
  - Why isn't Kubeflow multi-cluster agnostic?


## Learning for us
We had the chance to explore projects like [KitOps](https://kitops.org/), which offered an exciting early glimpse into the future of the AI/ML ecosystem. KitOps is an open-source tool designed for AI/ML DevOps, focused on standardizing how machine learning projects are packaged, versioned, and securely shared. Built on the Open Container Initiative (OCI) standard, it integrates seamlessly with existing DevOps and software development workflows.

## Conclusion

KubeCon India 2025 showcased the vibrant cloud-native ML community and highlighted KubeFlow's role in enabling scalable, production-grade machine learning on Kubernetes.
