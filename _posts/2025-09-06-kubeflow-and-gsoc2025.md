## Introduction

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025 has been an exciting journey for the Kubeflow community! We are very grateful for Google and the open source community for their commitment, dedication and efforts.🎉  
This year, 9 contributors from around the world collaborated with mentors to improve different parts of the Kubeflow ecosystem — from infrastructure and CI/CD, to notebooks, ML workflows, and beyond.

In this blog, we’re highlighting all the projects that were part of **GSoC 2025**, their goals, the impact they’ve created, and the amazing contributors behind them.  

👉 You can explore the full list on our [GSoC 2025 page](https://www.kubeflow.org/events/gsoc-2025/).

## 📚 Project Highlights

Below are the projects from this year’s GSoC. Each section includes a short summary, contributor details, and links to project resources.

---

### Project 1: Kubeflow Platform Enhancements
**Contributor:** Harshvir Potpose ([@akagami-harsh](https://github.com/akagami-harsh))
**Mentors:** Julius von Kohout ([@juliusvonkohout](https://github.com/juliusvonkohout))

**Overview:**  
MinIO transitioned to the AGPLv3 license in 2021, creating significant compliance challenges for Kubeflow Pipelines. The AGPL's copyleft provisions require that any software linking to AGPL-licensed components must also adopt the AGPL license, effectively preventing KFP from upgrading to newer MinIO versions without changing its own licensing model.

This project addressed this critical blocker by implementing SeaweedFS as a production-ready replacement for MinIO. SeaweedFS offers a more permissive Apache 2.0 license while providing superior performance characteristics and enterprise-grade reliability.

**Key Outcomes:**  
- Successfully migrated to SeaweedFS as a secure replacement for MinIO and integrated it into Kubeflow Pipelines
- Eliminated MinIO's licensing constraints by adopting SeaweedFS's more permissive license model
- Implemented comprehensive CI tests for SeaweedFS deployment and namespace isolation functionality
- Strengthened the manifests repository's CI pipeline and contributed to the dashboard migration efforts
- Enforcing PodSecurityStandars baseline/restricted

### Project 3: Istio CNI and Ambient Mesh
**Contributor:** Ayush Gupta (GitHub: [@madmecodes](https://github.com/madmecodes))  
**Mentors:** Julius von Kohout ([@juliusvonkohout](https://github.com/juliusvonkohout)), Kimonas Sotirchos ([@kimwnasptd](https://github.com/kimwnasptd))  

**Overview:**  
This GSoC 2025 project modernized Kubeflow's service mesh infrastructure by implementing Istio CNI as the default configuration and pioneering Istio Ambient Mesh support. The 175-hour medium-difficulty project involved 25+ pull requests across multiple Kubeflow repositories, transitioning from traditional sidecar-based architecture to ambient mesh with ztunnel and waypoint proxies, pioneering the migration to Gateway API (HTTPRoute), implementing path-based routing for KServe model serving endpoints, and utilizing Kustomize overlay method for easy installation and configuration management.

**Key Outcomes:**  
- Implemented Istio CNI by default with Kustomize overlay method enabling easy switching between traditional Istio and CNI configurations
- Created path-based routing for KServe multi-model serving and Gateway API (HTTPRoute) migration
- Pioneered Ambient Mesh support with ztunnel/waypoint proxies and coordinating cross-repository compatibility

### Project 4: Deploying Kubeflow with Helm Charts

**Contributor:** Kunal Dugar ([@kunal-511](https://github.com/kunal-511))  
**Mentors:** Julius von Kohout ([@juliusvonkohout](https://github.com/juliusvonkohout)), Valentina Rodriguez Sosa ([@varodrig](https://github.com/varodrig)), Chase Cadet ([@Chasecadet](https://github.com/Chasecadet))

**Overview:**  
This project focused on creating component-based Helm charts for Kubeflow, enabling flexible and incremental deployment of ML infrastructure. Instead of requiring a full platform installation, users can now deploy specific components like Katib, Pipelines, Model Registry, and others independently with customized configurations.

**Key Outcomes:**  
- Kubeflow AI reference paltform end to end testing
- Created production-ready Helm charts for Katib, Model Registry, KServe Web App, Notebook Controller, and Kubeflow Pipelines—enabling one-command deployment of individual components
- Built automated testing infrastructure with diff tools to validate Helm charts against Kustomize manifests, ensuring accuracy and catching regressions quickly
- Enabled incremental Kubeflow adoption, reducing deployment complexity from days to hours for organizations building production ML platforms

### Project 7: GPU Testing for LLM Blueprints

**Contributor:** Akash Jaiswal ([@jaiakash](https://github.com/jaiakash))  
**Mentors:** Andrey Velichkevich ([@andreyvelich](https://github.com/andreyvelich)), Valentina Rodriguez Sosa([@varodrig](https://github.com/varodrig))

![Diagram](/images/2025-09-06-kubeflow-and-gsoc2025/project7.png)

**Overview:**  
We had a few examples in the repository that we wanted to include in our end-to-end (E2E) tests, but all of them were CPU-based. Projects like Torchune and Qwen 2.5, for instance, require GPU resources to run — yet our existing CI setup couldn’t validate them at all because it was entirely CPU-focused.

This created a major gap: whenever someone contributed a new LLM example or modified the trainer logic, we had no automated way to verify if those changes would work in a GPU environment — the same environment where these workloads are actually deployed in production.

The goal of this project was to add CI with GPU support directly into our CI/CD workflow.

**Key Outcomes:**  

- Integrating GPU runners into GitHub Actions so that any pull request could automatically trigger GPU-backed E2E tests.

- Making the setup scalable and cost-efficient — instead of maintaining expensive GPU machines 24/7, we needed an on-demand system that provisions GPU resources only when a test is triggered.

### Project 10: Support Volcano Scheduler in Kubeflow Trainer
**Contributor:** Xinmin Du (GitHub: [@Doris-xm](https://github.com/Doris-xm))  
**Mentors:** Shao Wang ([@Electronic-Waste](https://github.com/Electronic-Waste)), Yuchen Cheng([@rudeigerc](https://github.com/rudeigerc))

**Overview:**  
The project aims to integrate the **Volcano scheduler** into Kubeflow Trainer as a **runtime plugin**.
This will allow users to take advantage of advanced AI-specific scheduling features, such as Gang Scheduling and priority scheduling, supported by Volcano.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Integrate the **Volcano** scheduler into Trainer as a runtime plugin to support Gang Scheduling and resource management for distributed training jobs.
- Enabled AI-specific features such as priority scheduling, queue-based management, and network topology–aware scheduling.
