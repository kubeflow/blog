            "content": "The Problem . Kubeflow is a fast-growing open source project that makes it easy to deploy and manage machine learning on Kubernetes. . Due to Kubeflow’s explosive popularity, we receive a large influx of GitHub issues that must be triaged and routed to the appropriate subject matter expert. The below chart illustrates the number of new issues opened for the past year: . . Figure 1: Number of Kubeflow Issues To keep up with this influx, we started investing in a Github App called Issue Label Bot that used machine learning to auto label issues. Our first model was trained using a collection of popular public repositories on GitHub and only predicted generic labels. Subsequently, we started using Google AutoML to train a Kubeflow specific model. The new model was able to predict Kubeflow specific labels with average precision of 72% and average recall of 50%. This significantly reduced the toil associated with issue management for Kubeflow maintainers. The table below contains evaluation metrics for Kubeflow specific labels on a holdout set. The precision and recall below coincide with prediction thresholds that we calibrated to suit our needs. . Label Precision Recall . area-backend | 0.6 | 0.4 | . area-bootstrap | 0.3 | 0.1 | . area-centraldashboard | 0.6 | 0.6 | . area-components | 0.5 | 0.3 | . area-docs | 0.8 | 0.7 | . area-engprod | 0.8 | 0.5 | . area-front-end | 0.7 | 0.5 | . area-frontend | 0.7 | 0.4 | . area-inference | 0.9 | 0.5 | . area-jupyter | 0.9 | 0.7 | . area-katib | 0.8 | 1.0 | . area-kfctl | 0.8 | 0.7 | . area-kustomize | 0.3 | 0.1 | . area-operator | 0.8 | 0.7 | . area-pipelines | 0.7 | 0.4 | . area-samples | 0.5 | 0.5 | . area-sdk | 0.7 | 0.4 | . area-sdk-dsl | 0.6 | 0.4 | . area-sdk-dsl-compiler | 0.6 | 0.4 | . area-testing | 0.7 | 0.7 | . area-tfjob | 0.4 | 0.4 | . platform-aws | 0.8 | 0.5 | . platform-gcp | 0.8 | 0.6 | . Table 1: Evaluation metrics for various Kubeflow labels. Given the rate at which new issues are arriving, retraining our model periodically became a priority. We believe continuously retraining and deploying our model to leverage this new data is critical to maintaining the efficacy of our models. . Our Solution . Our CI/CD solution is illustrated in Figure 2. We don’t explicitly create a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to connect the steps in an ML workflow (e.g. preprocessing, training, validation, deployment, etc…). Rather, we use a set of independent controllers. Each controller declaratively describes the desired state of the world and takes actions necessary to make the actual state of the world match. This independence makes it easy for us to use whatever tools make the most sense for each step. More specifically we use . Jupyter notebooks for developing models. | GitOps for continuous integration and deployment. | Kubernetes and managed cloud services for underlying infrastructure. | . . Figure 2: illustrates how we do CI/CD. Our pipeline today consists of two independently operating controllers. We configure the Trainer (left hand side) by describing what models we want to exist; i.e. what it means for our models to be “fresh”. The Trainer periodically checks whether the set of trained models are sufficiently fresh and if not trains a new model. We likewise configure the Deployer (right hand side) to define what it means for the deployed model to be in sync with the set of trained models. If the correct model is not deployed it will deploy a new model. For more details on model training and deployment refer to the Actuation section below. . Background . Building Resilient Systems With Reconcilers . A reconciler is a control pattern that has proven to be immensely useful for building resilient systems. The reconcile pattern is at the heart of how Kubernetes works. Figure 3 illustrates how a reconciler works. A reconciler works by first observing the state of the world; e.g. what model is currently deployed. The reconciler then compares this against the desired state of the world and computes the diff; e.g the model with label “version=20200724” should be deployed, but the model currently deployed has label “version=20200700”. The reconciler then takes the action necessary to drive the world to the desired state; e.g. open a pull request to change the deployed model. . . Figure 3. Illustration of the reconciler pattern as applied by our deployer. Reconcilers have proven immensely useful for building resilient systems because a well implemented reconciler provides a high degree of confidence that no matter how a system is perturbed it will eventually return to the desired state. . There is no DAG . The declarative nature of controllers means data can flow through a series of controllers without needing to explicitly create a DAG. In lieu of a DAG, a series of data processing steps can instead be expressed as a set of desired states, as illustrated in Figure 4 below: . . Figure 4: illustrates how pipelines can emerge from independent controllers without explicitly encoding a DAG. Here we have two completely independent controllers. The first controller ensures that for every element ai there should be an element bi. The second controller ensures that for every element bi there should be an element ci. This reconciler-based paradigm offers the following benefits over many traditional DAG-based workflows: . Resilience against failures: the system continuously seeks to achieve and maintain the desired state. | Increased autonomy of engineering teams: each team is free to choose the tools and infrastructure that suit their needs. The reconciler framework only requires a minimal amount of coupling between controllers while still allowing one to write expressive workflows. | Battle tested patterns and tools: This reconciler based framework does not invent something new. Kubernetes has a rich ecosystem of tools that aim to make it easy to build controllers. The popularity of Kubernetes means there is a large and growing community familiar with this pattern and supporting tools. | . GitOps: Operation By Pull Request . GitOps, Figure 5, is a pattern for managing infrastructure. The core idea of GitOps is that source control (doesn’t have to be git) should be the source of truth for configuration files describing your infrastructure. Controllers can then monitor source control and automatically update your infrastructure as your config changes. This means to make a change (or undo a change) you just open a pull request. . . Figure 5: To push a new model for Label Bot we create a PR updating the config map storing the id of the Auto ML model we want to use. When the PR is merged, Anthos Config Management(ACM) automatically rolls out those changes to our GKE cluster. As a result, subsequent predictions are made using the new model. (Image courtesy of Weaveworks) Putting It Together: Reconciler + GitOps = CI/CD for ML . With that background out of the way, let’s dive into how we built CI/CD for ML by combining the Reconciler and GitOps patterns. . There were three problems we needed to solve: . How do we compute the diff between the desired and actual state of the world? | How do we affect the changes needed to make the actual state match the desired state? | How do we build a control loop to continuously run 1 &amp; 2? | Computing Diffs . To compute the diffs we just write lambdas that do exactly what we want. So in this case we wrote two lambdas: . The first lambda determines whether we need to retrain based on the age of the most recent model. | The second lambda determines whether the model needs to be updated by comparing the most recently trained model to the model listed in a config map checked into source control. | We wrap these lambdas in a simple web server and deploy on Kubernetes. One reason we chose this approach is because we wanted to rely on Kubernetes’ git-sync to mirror our repository to a pod volume. This makes our lambdas super simple because all the git management is taken care of by a side-car running git-sync. . Actuation . To apply the changes necessary, we use Tekton to glue together various CLIs that we use to perform the various steps. . Model Training . To train our model we have a Tekton task that: . Runs our notebook using papermill. | Converts the notebook to html using nbconvert. | Uploads the .ipynb and .html files to GCS using gsutil | This notebook fetches GitHub Issues data from BigQuery and generates CSV files on GCS suitable for import into Google AutoML. The notebook then launches an AutoML job to train a model. . We chose AutoML because we wanted to focus on building a complete end to end solution rather than iterating on the model. AutoML provides a competitive baseline that we may try to improve upon in the future. . To easily view the executed notebook we convert it to html and upload it to GCS which makes it easy to serve public, static content. This allows us to use notebooks to generate rich visualizations to evaluate our model. . Model Deployment . To deploy our model we have a Tekton task that: . Uses kpt to update our configmap with the desired value. | Runs git to push our changes to a branch. | Uses a wrapper around the GitHub CLI (gh) to create a PR. | The controller ensures there is only one Tekton pipeline running at a time. We configure our pipelines to always push to the same branch. This ensures we only ever open one PR to update the model because GitHub doesn’t allow multiple PRs to be created from the same branch. . Once the PR is merged Anthos Config Mesh automatically applies the Kubernetes manifests to our Kubernetes cluster. . Why Tekton . We picked Tekton because the primary challenge we faced was sequentially running a series of CLIs in various containers. Tekton is perfect for this. Importantly, all the steps in a Tekton task run on the same pod which allows data to be shared between steps using a pod volume. . Furthermore, since Tekton resources are Kubernetes resources we can adopt the same GitOps pattern and tooling to update our pipeline definitions. . The Control Loop . Finally, we needed to build a control loop that would periodically invoke our lambdas and launch our Tekton pipelines as needed. We used kubebuilder to create a simple custom controller. Our controller’s reconcile loop will call our lambda to determines whether a sync is needed and if so with what parameters. If a sync is needed the controller fires off a Tekton pipeline to perform the actual update. An example of our custom resource is illustrated below: . apiVersion: automl.cloudai.kubeflow.org/v1alpha1 kind: ModelSync metadata: name: modelsync-sample namespace: label-bot-prod spec: failedPipelineRunsHistoryLimit: 10 needsSyncUrl: http://labelbot-diff.label-bot-prod/needsSync parameters: - needsSyncName: name pipelineName: automl-model pipelineRunTemplate: spec: params: - name: automl-model value: notavlidmodel - name: branchName value: auto-update - name: fork value: git@github.com:kubeflow/code-intelligence.git - name: forkName value: fork pipelineRef: name: update-model-pr resources: - name: repo resourceSpec: params: - name: url value: https://github.com/kubeflow/code-intelligence.git - name: revision value: master type: git serviceAccountName: auto-update successfulPipelineRunsHistoryLimit: 10 . The custom resource specifies the endpoint, needsSyncUrl, for the lambda that computes whether a sync is needed and a Tekton PipelineRun, pipelineRunTemplate, describing the pipeline run to create when a sync is needed. The controller takes care of the details; e.g. ensuring only 1 pipeline per resource is running at a time, garbage collecting old runs, etc… All of the heavy lifting is taken care of for us by Kubernetes and kubebuilder. . Note, for historical reasons the kind, ModelSync, and apiVersion automl.cloudai.kubeflow.org are not reflective of what the controller actually does. We plan on fixing this in the future. . Build Your Own CI/CD pipelines . Our code base is a long way from being polished, easily reusable tooling. Nonetheless it is all public and could be a useful starting point for trying to build your own pipelines. . Here are some pointers to get you started: . Use the Dockerfile to build your own ModelSync controller | Modify the kustomize package to use your image and deploy the controller | Define one or more lambdas as needed for your use cases You can use our Lambda server as an example | We wrote ours in go but you can use any language and web framework you like (e.g. flask) | . | Define Tekton pipelines suitable for your use cases; our pipelines(linked below) might be a useful starting point Notebook Tekton task - Run notebook with papermill and upload to GCS | PR Tekton Task - Tekton task to open GitHub PRs | . | Define ModelSync resources for your use case; you can refer to ours as an example ModelSync Deploy Spec - YAML to continuously deploy label bot | ModelSync Train Spec - YAML to continuously train our model | . | If you’d like to see us clean it up and include it in a future Kubeflow release please chime in on issue kubeflow/kubeflow#5167. . What’s Next . Lineage Tracking . Since we do not have an explicit DAG representing the sequence of steps in our CI/CD pipeline understanding the lineage of our models can be challenging. Fortunately, Kubeflow Metadata solves this by making it easy for each step to record information about what outputs it produced using what code and inputs. Kubeflow metadata can easily recover and plot the lineage graph. The figure below shows an example of the lineage graph from our xgboost example. . . Figure 6: screenshot of the lineage tracking UI for our xgboost example. Our plan is to have our controller automatically write lineage tracking information to the metadata server so we can easily understand the lineage of what’s in production. . Conclusion . . Building ML products is a team effort. In order to move a model from a proof of concept to a shipped product, data scientists and devops engineers need to collaborate. To foster this collaboration, we believe it is important to allow data scientists and devops engineers to use their preferred tools. Concretely, we wanted to support the following tools for Data Scientists, Devops Engineers, and SREs: . Jupyter notebooks for developing models. | GitOps for continuous integration and deployment. | Kubernetes and managed cloud services for underlying infrastructure. | . To maximize each team’s autonomy and reduce dependencies on tools, our CI/CD process follows a decentralized approach. Rather than explicitly define a DAG that connects the steps, our approach relies on a series of controllers that can be defined and administered independently. We think this maps naturally to enterprises where responsibilities might be split across teams; a data engineering team might be responsible for turning weblogs into features, a modeling team might be responsible for producing models from the features, and a deployments team might be responsible for rolling those models into production. .

If you are new to Kale, head over to this short introduction to get started! . In this blog post, you will learn about the features that Kale is bringing to the Machine Learning community with version 0.5, and learn how to get started with a curated example. . New Face . First off, we are excited to reveal the new Kale logo. Kudos to Konstantinos Palaiologos (Arrikto) for designing the brand new, modern Kale leaf. This will be the new face of the project from now on. . . Hyperparameter Tuning . The major new addition in v0.5 is the support for running pipelines with Katib. Katib is Kubeflow’s component to run general purpose hyperparameter tuning jobs. Just as you would press a single button to convert a notebook to a pipeline, you can now press a button and let Kale start a hyperparameter Job on that pipeline. All you need to do is tell Kale what the HP tuning job should search for. . Running hyperparameter tuning jobs gives you a dramatic boost in delivering good results for your project. The *manual *tuning process of running your model countless times, using different parameters combinations, aggregating them and comparing them, is error-prone and inefficient. Delegating this work to an automated process allows you to become faster, more efficient and accurate. . Parametrize the HP tuning Job directly from the notebook . Katib does not know anything about the jobs that it is actually running (called Trials in the Katib jargon). Katib supports running Trials as simple Jobs (that is, Pods), BatchJobs, TFJobs, and PyTorchJobs. Kale 0.5 integrates Katib with Kubeflow Pipelines. This enables Katib trails to run as pipelines in KFP. The metrics from the pipeline runs are provided to help in model performance analysis and debugging. All Kale needs to know from the user is the search space, the optimization algorithm, and the search goal. . Kale will also make sure that all the runs of a Katib experiment, end up unified and grouped, under a single KFP experiment, to make it easy to search and isolate a particular job. . Kale will also show a live view of the running experiments, directly in the notebook, so you will know how many pipelines are still running and, upon completion, which one performed best. . New features . Pipeline parameters and metrics . In order to run pipelines with hyperparameter tuning, the pipeline needs to be able to accept arguments and produce metrics. Enabling the pipeline to do this, is now tremendously easy. Kale provides two new cell tags: pipeline-parameters and pipeline-metrics. . . Assigning the pipeline-parameters tag on any cell that contains some variables will instruct Kale to transform them to pipeline parameters. These values will then be passed to the pipeline steps that actually make use of them. . . If you want the pipeline to produce some metrics, just print them at the end of the notebook and assign the pipeline-metrics tag to the cell. Kale will take care of understanding which steps produce the metrics and you will see them appear in the KFP dashboard. . Rich notebook outputs . Having your pipelines produce rich outputs (like plots, tables, metrics, …) that can be captured and displayed by the Kubeflow Pipelines dashboard has always been somewhat cumbersome. You would need to write some KFP-specific code to produce json artifacts that would then be interpreted by KFP. . What if you could just write plain Python in your Notebook using your favourite plotting library, and have the plots auto-magically appear as KFP outputs, when the Notebook gets compiled into a pipeline? . Now, when running your notebook code inside a pipeline step, Kale will wrap it and feed it to an ipython kernel, so that all the nice artifacts produced in the notebook, will be produced in the pipeline as well. Kale will capture all these rich outputs automatically and instruct KFP to display them in the dashboard. Effectively, whatever happens in the notebook, now happens in the pipeline as well. The execution context is exactly the same. . Any rich output that is visible in the notebook gets captured by Kale and exposed in the KFP dashboard. . MLMD Integration . An important part of running reproducible Machine Learning collaboratively and at scale, is being able to track pipeline executions, their inputs, their outputs and how these are connected together. Kubeflow provides an ML Metadata service which serves this exact purpose. This service also includes a lineage view to enable the user to have a deep insight into the whole history of events. . Kale is now fully integrated with this service, logging each new execution automatically alongside all the artifacts produced by the pipeline. . Run on GPU . If you need to run a particular step on a GPU node, Kale has you covered too. You can now annotate steps with a dedicated dialog, directly from the notebook and each step can have its own annotations. This is just the first iteration, Kale will support adding any kind of K8s limits or annotations to pipeline steps in the near future. . . Overall UI and performance improvements . The new version of Kale’s JupyterLab brings tons of performance improvements and UI enhancements. Updating the notebook cells’ annotations will now be easier and faster. We covered many corner cases and solved tons of bugs. The UI of the cell’s annotation editor is more consistent with the overall Jupyter style and much more intuitive and easy to use. A big shoutout to Tasos Alexiou (Arrikto) for having spent countless hours in understanding the Jupyter internals and improving our application lifecycle. . Hands-On . To start playing-around with Kale v0.5, head over to the GitHub repository and follow the installation instructions. If you are already running Kubeflow (either in your own cluster or on MiniKF), spin up a new Notebook Server using the image gcr.io/arrikto/jupyter-kale:v0.5.0. . Note: Kale v0.5 needs to run on Kubeflow ≥ 1.0. Also, make sure that the following Kubeflow components are updated as follows: . Katib controller: gcr.io/arrikto/katib-controller:40b5b51a . | Katib Chocolate service: gcr.io/arrikto/suggestion-chocolate:40b5b51a . | . We will release a new version of MiniKF very soon, containing a lot of improvements that will make the Kale experience even better. You will also be able to go through a new Codelab to try out the Kale-Katib integration yourself. Stay tuned for updates on the Arrikto channels. . Road Ahead . We are always looking to improve Kale and help data scientists have a seamless ML workflow from writing code to training, optimizing, and serving their models. . We are excited to have the ML community try out this new version of Kale and the coming MiniKF update. . A special mention must go to the various members of the Arrikto team (Ilias Katsakioris, Chris Pavlou, Kostis Lolos, Tasos Alexiou) who contributed to delivering all these new features. .",

            "title": "Introduction to Kubeflow MPI Operator and Industry Adoption",
            "content": "Kubeflow just announced its first major 1.0 release recently, which makes it easy for machine learning engineers and data scientists to leverage cloud assets (public or on-premise) for machine learning workloads. In this post, we’d like to introduce MPI Operator (docs), one of the core components of Kubeflow, currently in alpha, which makes it easy to run synchronized, allreduce-style distributed training on Kubernetes. . There are two major distributed training strategies nowadays: one based on parameter servers and the other based on collective communication primitives such as allreduce. . Parameter server based distribution strategy relies on centralized parameter servers for coordination between workers, responsible for collecting gradients from workers and sending updated parameters to workers. The diagram below shows the interaction between parameter servers and worker nodes under this distributed training strategy. . . While distributed training based on parameter servers can support training very large models and datasets by adding more workers and parameter servers, there are additional challenges involved in order to optimize the performance: . It is not easy to identify the right ratio of the number of workers to the number of parameter servers. For example, if only a small number of parameter servers are used, network communication will likely become the bottleneck for training. . | If many parameter servers are used, the communication may saturate network interconnects. . | The memory quota of workers and parameter servers requires fine tuning to avoid out-of-memory errors or memory waste. . | If the model could fit within the computational resources of each worker, additional maintenance and communication overheads are introduced when the model is partitioned to multiple parameter servers. . | We need to replicate the model on each parameter server in order to support fault-tolerance, which requires additional computational and storage resources. . | . In contrast, distributed training based on collective communication primitives such as allreduce could be more efficient and easier to use in certain use cases. Under allreduce-based distributed training strategy, each worker stores a complete set of model parameters. In other words, no parameter server is needed. Allreduce-based distributed training could address many of the challenges mentioned above: . Each worker stores a complete set of model parameters, no parameter server is needed, so it’s straightforward to add more workers when necessary. . | Failures among the workers can be recovered easily by restarting the failed workers and then load the current model from any of the existing workers. Model does not need to be replicated to support fault-tolerance. . | The model can be updated more efficiently by fully leveraging the network structure and collective communication algorithms. For example, in ring-allreduce algorithm, each of the N workers only needs to communicate with two of its peer workers 2 * (N − 1) times to update all the model parameters completely. . | Scaling up and down the number of workers is as easy as reconstructing the underlying allreduce communicator and re-assigning the ranks among the workers. . | . There are many existing technologies available that provide implementations for these collective communication primitives such as NCCL, Gloo, and many different implementations of MPI. . MPI Operator provides a common Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for defining a training job on a single CPU/GPU, multiple CPU/GPUs, and multiple nodes. It also implements a custom controller to manage the CRD, create dependent resources, and reconcile the desired states. . . Unlike other operators in Kubeflow such as TF Operator and PyTorch Operator that only supports for one machine learning framework, MPI operator is decoupled from underlying framework so it can work well with many frameworks such as Horovod, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Apache MXNet, and various collective communication implementations such as OpenMPI. . For more details on comparisons between different distributed training strategies, various Kubeflow operators, please check out our presentation at KubeCon Europe 2019. . Example API Spec . We’ve been working closely with the community and industry adopters to improve the API spec for MPI Operator so it’s suitable for many different use cases. Below is an example: . apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v1alpha2 kind: MPIJob metadata: name: tensorflow-benchmarks spec: slotsPerWorker: 1 cleanPodPolicy: Running mpiReplicaSpecs: Launcher: replicas: 1 template: spec: containers: - image: mpioperator/tensorflow-benchmarks:latest name: tensorflow-benchmarks command: - mpirun - python - scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks/tf_cnn_benchmarks.py - --model=resnet101 - --batch_size=64 - --variable_update=horovod Worker: replicas: 2 template: spec: containers: - image: mpioperator/tensorflow-benchmarks:latest name: tensorflow-benchmarks resources: limits: nvidia.com/gpu: 1 . Note that MPI Operator provides a flexible but user-friendly API that’s consistent across other Kubeflow operators. . Users can easily customize their launcher and worker pod specs by modifying the relevant sections in the template. For example, customizing to use various types of computational resources such as CPUs, GPUs, memory, etc. . In addition, below is an example spec that performs distributed TensorFlow training job using ImageNet data in TFRecords format stored in a Kubernetes volume: . apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v1alpha2 kind: MPIJob metadata: name: tensorflow-benchmarks spec: slotsPerWorker: 1 cleanPodPolicy: Running mpiReplicaSpecs: Launcher: replicas: 1 template: spec: containers: - image: mpioperator/tensorflow-benchmarks:latest name: tensorflow-benchmarks command: - mpirun - python - scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks/tf_cnn_benchmarks.py - --model=resnet101 - --batch_size=64 - --variable_update=horovod Worker: replicas: 2 template: spec: containers: - image: mpioperator/tensorflow-benchmarks:latest name: tensorflow-benchmarks resources: limits: nvidia.com/gpu: 1 . Architecture . MPI Operator contains a custom controller that listens for changes in MPIJob resources. When a new MPIJob is created, the controller goes through the following logical steps: . Create a ConfigMap that contains: | A helper shell script that can be used by mpirun in place of ssh. It invokes kubectl exec for remote execution. . | A hostfile that lists the pods in the worker StatefulSet (in the form of ${job-id}-worker-0, ${job-id}-worker-1, …), and the available slots (CPUs/GPUs) in each pod. . | . Create the RBAC resources (Role, ServiceAccount, RoleBinding) to allow remote execution (pods/exec). . | Wait for the worker pods to be ready. . | Create the launcher job. It runs under the ServiceAccount created in step 2, and sets up the necessary environment variables for executing mpirun commands remotely. The kubectl binary is delivered to an emptyDir volume through an init container. . | After the launcher job finishes, set the replicas to 0 in the worker StatefulSet. . | . For more details, please check out the design doc for MPI Operator. . Industry Adoption . At the time of writing, there are 13 disclosed industry adopters and many others who’ve been working closely with the community to reach where we are today. We’d like to showcase some of the use cases of MPI Operator in several companies. If your company would like to be included in the list of adopters, please send us a pull request on GitHub! . Ant Financial . At Ant Financial, we manage Kubernetes clusters with tens of thousands of nodes and have deployed the MPI Operator along with other Kubeflow operators. The MPI Operator leverages the network structure and collective communication algorithms so that users don’t have to worry about the right ratio between the number of workers and parameter servers to obtain the best performance. Users can focus on building out their model architectures without spending time on tuning the downstream infrastructure for distributed training. . The models produced have been widely deployed in production and battle-tested in many different real life scenarios. One notable use case is Saofu — a mobile app for users to scan any “福” (Chinese character that represents fortune) through augmented reality to enter a lucky draw where each user would receive a virtual red envelope with a portion of a significant amount of money. . Bloomberg . Bloomberg, the global business and financial information and news leader, possesses an enormous amount of data — from historical news to real-time market data and everything in between. Bloomberg’s Data Science Platform was built to allow the company’s internal machine learning engineers and data scientists to more easily leverage data and algorithmic models in their daily work, including when training jobs and automatic machine learning models used in the state-of-the-art solutions they’re building. . “The Data Science Platform at Bloomberg offers a TensorFlowJob CRD similar to Kubeflow’s own TFJob, enabling the company’s data scientists to easily train neural network models. Recently, the Data Science Platform team enabled Horovod-based distributed training in its TensorFlowJob via the MPI Operator as an implementation detail. Using MPIJob in the back-end has allowed the Bloomberg Data Science Platform team to quickly offer its machine learning engineers a robust way to train a BERT model within hours using the company’s large corpus of text data’’, says Chengjian Zheng, software engineer from Bloomberg. . Caicloud . Caicloud Clever is an artificial intelligence cloud platform based on Caicloud container cloud platform with powerful hardware resource management and efficient model development capabilities. Caicloud products have been deployed in many 500 China Fortune companies. . “Caicloud Clever supports multiple frameworks of AI model training including TensorFlow, Apache MXNet, Caffe, PyTorch with the help of Kubeflow tf-operator, pytorch-operator and others”, says Ce Gao, AI infrastructure engineer from Caicloud Clever team. “While RingAllReduce distributed training support is requested for improved customer maturity.” . Kubeflow MPI operator is a Kubernetes Operator for allreduce-style distributed training. Caicloud Clever team adopts MPI Operator’s v1alpha2 API. The Kubernetes native API makes it easy to work with the existing systems in the platform. . Iguazio . Iguazio provides a cloud-native data science platform with emphasis on automation, performance, scalability, and use of open-source tools. . According to Yaron Haviv, the Founder and CTO of Iguazio, “We evaluated various mechanisms which will allow us to scale deep learning frameworks with minimal developer effort and found that using the combination of Horovod with the MPI Operator over Kubernetes is the best tool for the job since it enable horizontal scalability, supports multiple frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch and doesn’t require too much extra coding or the complex use of parameter servers.” . Iguazio have integrated the MPI Operator into its managed service offering and its fast data layer for maximum scalability, and work to simplify the usage through open source projects like MLRun (for ML automation and tracking). Check out this blog post with an example application that demonstrates Iguazio’s usage of the MPI Operator. . Polyaxon . Polyaxon is a platform for reproducible and scalable machine learning on Kubernetes, it allows users to iterate faster on their research and model creation. Polyaxon provides a simple abstraction for data scientists and machine learning engineers to streamline their experimentation workflow, and provides a very cohesive abstraction for training and tracking models using popular frameworks such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Apache MXNet, Caffe, etc. . “Several Polyaxon users and customers were requesting an easy way to perform an allreduce-style distributed training, the MPI Operator was the perfect solution to provide such abstraction. Polyaxon is deployed at several companies and research institutions, and the public docker hub has over 9 million downloads.”, says Mourad Mourafiq, the Co-founder of Polyxagon. . Community and Call for Contributions . We are grateful for over 28 individual contributors from over 11 organizations, namely Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Ant Financial, Bloomberg, Caicloud, Google Cloud, Huawei, Iguazio, NVIDIA, Polyaxon, and Tencent, that have contributed directly to MPI Operator’s codebase and many others who’ve filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and answered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions. We’ve put together a roadmap that provides a high-level overview of where the MPI Operator will grow in future releases and we welcome any contributions from the community! . We could not have achieved our milestones without an incredibly active community. Check out our community page to learn more about how to join the Kubeflow community! .

            "title": "Kubeflow 1.0 - Cloud Native ML for Everyone",
            "content": "Kubeflow 1.0: Cloud Native ML for Everyone . On behalf of the entire community, we are proud to announce Kubeflow 1.0, our first major release. Kubeflow was open sourced at Kubecon USA in December 2017, and during the last two years the Kubeflow Project has grown beyond our wildest expectations. There are now hundreds of contributors from over 30 participating organizations. . Kubeflow’s goal is to make it easy for machine learning (ML) engineers and data scientists to leverage cloud assets (public or on-premise) for ML workloads. You can use Kubeflow on any Kubernetes-conformant cluster. . With 1.0, we are graduating a core set of stable applications needed to develop, build, train, and deploy models on Kubernetes efficiently. (Read more in Kubeflow’s versioning policies and application requirements for graduation.) . Graduating applications include: . Kubeflow’s UI, the central dashboard . | Jupyter notebook controller and web app . | Tensorflow Operator (TFJob) and PyTorch Operator for distributed training . | kfctl for deployment and upgrades . | Profile controller and UI for multiuser management . | . Hear more about Kubeflow’s mission and 1.0 release in this interview with Kubeflow founder and core contributor Jeremy Lewi on the Kubernetes Podcast. . Develop, Build, Train, and Deploy with Kubeflow . Kubeflow’s 1.0 applications that make up our develop, build, train, deploy critical user journey. . With Kubeflow 1.0, users can use Jupyter to develop models. They can then use Kubeflow tools like fairing (Kubeflow’s python SDK) to build containers and create Kubernetes resources to train their models. Once they have a model, they can use KFServing to create and deploy a server for inference. . Getting Started with ML on Kubernetes . Kubernetes is an amazing platform for leveraging infrastructure (whether on public cloud or on-premises), but deploying Kubernetes optimized for ML and integrated with your cloud is no easy task. With 1.0 we are providing a CLI and configuration files so you can deploy Kubeflow with one command: . kfctl apply -f [kfctl_gcp_iap.v1.0.0.yaml](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/master/kfdef/kfctl_gcp_iap.yaml) kfctl apply -f [kfctl_k8s_istio.v1.0.0.yaml](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/master/kfdef/kfctl_gcp_iap.yaml) kfctl apply -f [kfctl_aws_cognito.v1.0.0.yaml](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/master/kfdef/kfctl_gcp_iap.yaml) kfctl apply -f [kfctl_ibm.v1.0.0.yaml](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/master/kfdef/kfctl_gcp_iap.yaml) . Jupyter on Kubernetes . In Kubeflow’s user surveys, data scientists have consistently expressed the importance of Jupyter notebooks. Further, they need the ability to integrate isolated Jupyter notebooks with the efficiencies of Kubernetes on Cloud to train larger models using GPUs and run multiple experiments in parallel. Kubeflow makes it easy to leverage Kubernetes for resource management and put the full power of your datacenter at the fingertips of your data scientist. . With Kubeflow, each data scientist or team can be given their own namespace in which to run their workloads. Namespaces provide security and resource isolation. Using Kubernetes resource quotas, platform administrators can easily limit how much resources an individual or team can consume to ensure fair scheduling. . After deploying Kubeflow, users can leverage Kubeflow’s central dashboard for launching notebooks: . Kubeflow’s UI for managing notebooks: view and connect to existing notebooks or launch a new one. . In the Kubeflow UI users can easily launch new notebooks by choosing one of the pre-built docker images for Jupyter or entering the URL of a custom image. Next, users can set how many CPUs and GPUs to attach to their notebook. Notebooks can also include configuration and secrets parameters which simplify access to external repositories and databases. . . Training faster with distributed training . Distributed training is the norm at Google (blog), and one of the most exciting and requested features for deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. . When we started Kubeflow, one of our key motivations was to leverage Kubernetes to simplify distributed training. Kubeflow provides Kubernetes custom resources that make distributed training with TensorFlow and PyTorch simple. All a user needs to do is define a TFJob or PyTorch resource like the one illustrated below. The custom controller takes care of spinning up and managing all of the individual processes and configuring them to talk to one another: . apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v1 kind: TFJob metadata: name: mnist-train spec: tfReplicaSpecs: Chief: replicas: 1 spec: containers: image: gcr.io/alice-dev/fairing-job/mnist name: tensorflow Ps: replicas: 1 template: spec: containers: image: gcr.io/alice-dev/fairing-job/mnist name: tensorflow Worker: replicas: 10 spec: containers: image: gcr.io/alice-dev/fairing-job/mnist name: tensorflow . Monitoring Model Training With TensorBoard . To train high quality models, data scientists need to debug and monitor the training process with tools like Tensorboard. With Kubernetes and Kubeflow, userscan easily deploy TensorBoard on their Kubernetes cluster by creating YAML files like the ones below. When deploying TensorBoard on Kubeflow, users can take advantage of Kubeflow’s AuthN and AuthZ integration to securely access TensorBoard behind Kubeflow’s ingress on public clouds: . // On GCP: [https://${KFNAME}.endpoints.${PROJECT}.cloud.goog/mnist/kubeflow-mnist/tensorboard/](https://${KFNAME}.endpoints.${PROJECT}.cloud.goog/mnist/kubeflow-mnist/tensorboard/) // On AWS: [http://8fb34ebe-istiosystem-istio-2af2-925939634.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/mnist/anonymous/tensorboard/](http://8fb34ebe-istiosystem-istio-2af2-925939634.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/mnist/anonymous/tensorboard/) . No need to kubectl port-forward to individual pods. . Deploying Models . KFServing is a custom resource built on top of Knative for deploying and managing ML models. KFServing offers the following capabilities not provided by lower level primitives (e.g. Deployment): . Deploy your model using out-of-the-box model servers (no need to write your own flask app) . | Auto-scaling based on load, even for models served on GPUs . | Safe, controlled model rollout . | Explainability (alpha) . | Payload logging (alpha) . | Below is an example of a KFServing spec showing how a model can be deployed. All a user has to do is provide the URI of their model file using storageUri: . apiVersion: &quot;serving.kubeflow.org/v1alpha2&quot; kind: &quot;InferenceService&quot; metadata: name: &quot;sklearn-iris&quot; spec: default: predictor: sklearn: storageUri: &quot;gs://kfserving-samples/models/sklearn/iris&quot; . Check out the samples to learn how to use the above capabilities. . Solutions are More Than Models . A model gathering dust in object storage isn’t doing your organization any good. To put ML to work, you typically need to incorporate that model into an application – whether it’s a web application, mobile app, or part of some backend reporting pipeline. . Frameworks like flask and bootstrap make it easy for data scientists to create rich, visually appealing web applications that put their models to work. Below is a screenshot of the UI we built for Kubeflow’s mnist example. . With Kubeflow, there is no need for data scientists to learn new concepts or platforms to deploy their applications, or to deal with ingress, networking certificates, etc. They can deploy their application just like TensorBoard; the only thing that changes is the Docker image and flags. . . If this sounds like just what you are looking for we recommend: . Visiting our docs to learn how to deploy Kubeflow on your public or private cloud. . | Walking through the mnist tutorial to try our core applications yourself. . | What’s coming in Kubeflow . There’s much more to Kubeflow than what we’ve covered in this blog post. In addition to the applications listed here, we have a number of applications under development: . Pipelines (beta) for defining complex ML workflows . | Metadata (beta) for tracking datasets, jobs, and models, . | Katib (beta) for hyper-parameter tuning . | Distributed operators for other frameworks like xgboost . | . In future releases we will be graduating these applications to 1.0. . User testimonials . All this would be nothing without feedback from and collaboration with our users. Some feedback from people using Kubeflow in production include: . *“The Kubeflow 1.0 release is a significant milestone as it positions Kubeflow to be a viable ML Enterprise platform. Kubeflow 1.0 delivers material productivity enhancements for ML researchers.” — *Jeff Fogarty, AVP ML / Cloud Engineer, US Bank . *“Kubeflow’s data and model storage allows for smooth integration into CI/CD processes, allowing for a much faster and more agile delivery of machine learning models into applications.” — *Laura Schornack, **Shared Services Architect, Chase Commercial Bank** . *“With the launch of Kubeflow 1.0 we now have a feature complete end-to-end open source machine learning platform, allowing everyone from small teams to large unicorns like Gojek to run ML at scale.” — *Willem Pienaar, Engineering Lead, Data Science Platform, GoJek . *“Kubeflow provides a seamless interface to a great set of tools that together manages the complexity of ML workflows and encourages best practices. The Data Science and Machine Learning teams at Volvo Cars are able to iterate and deliver reproducible, production grade services with ease.”— *Leonard Aukea, Volvo Cars . “With Kubeflow at the heart of our ML platform, our small company has been able to stack models in production to improve CR, find new customers, and present the right product to the right customer at the right time.” *— *Senior Director, One Technologies . “Kubeflow is helping GroupBy in standardizing ML workflows and simplifying very complicated deployments!” *— *Mohamed Elsaied, Machine Learning Team Lead, GroupBy .

Example 1: DropDown . # single-value selection over [Major_Genre, MPAA_Rating] pairs # use specific hard-wired values as the initial selected values selection = alt.selection_single( name=&#39;Select&#39;, fields=[&#39;Major_Genre&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;], init={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: &#39;Drama&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: &#39;R&#39;}, bind={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: alt.binding_select(options=genres), &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: alt.binding_radio(options=mpaa)} ) # scatter plot, modify opacity based on selection alt.Chart(df).mark_circle().add_selection( selection ).encode( x=&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;, y=&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, tooltip=&#39;Title:N&#39;, opacity=alt.condition(selection, alt.value(0.75), alt.value(0.05)) ) . Example 2: Tooltips . alt.Chart(df).mark_circle().add_selection( alt.selection_interval(bind=&#39;scales&#39;, encodings=[&#39;x&#39;]) ).encode( alt.X(&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating&#39;, type=&#39;quantitative&#39;), alt.Y(&#39;IMDB_Rating&#39;, type=&#39;quantitative&#39;, axis=alt.Axis(minExtent=30)), # y=alt.Y(&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, ), # use min extent to stabilize axis title placement tooltip=[&#39;Title:N&#39;, &#39;Release_Date:N&#39;, &#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, &#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;] ).properties( width=500, height=400 ) . Example 3: More Tooltips . # select a point for which to provide details-on-demand label = alt.selection_single( encodings=[&#39;x&#39;], # limit selection to x-axis value on=&#39;mouseover&#39;, # select on mouseover events nearest=True, # select data point nearest the cursor empty=&#39;none&#39; # empty selection includes no data points ) # define our base line chart of stock prices base = alt.Chart().mark_line().encode( alt.X(&#39;date:T&#39;), alt.Y(&#39;price:Q&#39;, scale=alt.Scale(type=&#39;log&#39;)), alt.Color(&#39;symbol:N&#39;) ) alt.layer( base, # base line chart # add a rule mark to serve as a guide line alt.Chart().mark_rule(color=&#39;#aaa&#39;).encode( x=&#39;date:T&#39; ).transform_filter(label), # add circle marks for selected time points, hide unselected points base.mark_circle().encode( opacity=alt.condition(label, alt.value(1), alt.value(0)) ).add_selection(label), # add white stroked text to provide a legible background for labels base.mark_text(align=&#39;left&#39;, dx=5, dy=-5, stroke=&#39;white&#39;, strokeWidth=2).encode( text=&#39;price:Q&#39; ).transform_filter(label), # add text labels for stock prices base.mark_text(align=&#39;left&#39;, dx=5, dy=-5).encode( text=&#39;price:Q&#39; ).transform_filter(label), data=stocks ).properties( width=500, height=400 ) . Data Tables .

This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
