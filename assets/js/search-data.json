            "content": "By Dan Sun and Animesh Singh on behalf of the Kubeflow Serving Working Group . KFServing is now KServe . We are excited to announce the next chapter for KFServing. In coordination with the Kubeflow Project Steering Group, the KFServing GitHub repository has now been transferred to an independent KServe GitHub organization under the stewardship of the Kubeflow Serving Working Group leads. . The project has been rebranded from KFServing to KServe, and we are planning to graduate the project from Kubeflow Project later this year. . . Developed collaboratively by Google, IBM, Bloomberg, NVIDIA, and Seldon in 2019, KFServing was published as open source in early 2019. The project sets out to provide the following features: . A simple, yet powerful, Kubernetes Custom Resource for deploying machine learning (ML) models on production across ML frameworks. | Provide performant, standardized inference protocol. | Serverless inference according to live traffic patterns, supporting “Scale-to-zero” on both CPUs and GPUs. | Complete story for production ML Model Serving including prediction, pre/post-processing, explainability, and monitoring. | Support for deploying thousands of models at scale and inference graph capability for multiple models. | . KFServing was created to address the challenges of deploying and monitoring machine learning models on production for organizations. After publishing the open source project, we’ve seen an explosion in demand for the software, leading to strong adoption and community growth. The scope of the project has since increaded, and we have developed multiple components along the way, including our own growing body of documentation that needs it’s own website and independent GitHub organization. . What’s Next . Over the coming weeks, we will be releasing KServe 0.7 outside of the Kubeflow Project and will provide more details on how to migrate from KFServing to KServe with minimal disruptions. KFServing 0.5.x/0.6.x releases are still supported in next six months after KServe 0.7 release. We are also working on integrating core Kubeflow APIs and standards for the conformance program. . For contributors, please follow the KServe developer and doc contribution guide to make code or doc contributions. We are excited to work with you to make KServe better and promote its adoption by more and more users! . . KServe Key Links . Website | Github | Slack(#kubeflow-kfserving) | .

            "title": "Blog: Running Kubeflow at Intuit: Enmeshed in the service mesh",
            "content": "Deploying Kubeflow 1.3 in an enterprise with existing Kubernetes infrastructure, a Service Mesh (Istio), and Argo, presents a host of challenges. This blog will address how those challenges were overcome while retaining the best practices that both the organization and Kubeflow prescribe. . Lay of the land at Intuit . Intuit has invested heavily in building out a robust Kubernetes infrastructure that powers all of Intuit’s products: TurboTax, QuickBooks, and Mint. There are thousands of services that run on over a hundred Kubernetes clusters. Managing these clusters is the Intuit Kubernetes Service (IKS) control plane. The IKS control plane provides services such as namespace management, role management, and isolation, etc. Connecting the services is an advanced, Istio-based service mesh, which complements Intuit’s API Gateway. In combination, they provide robust authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and other routing capabilities. . The Intuit ML Platform is built on this ecosystem and provides model training, inference, and feature management capabilities, leveraging the best of Intuit’s Kubernetes infrastructure and AWS SageMaker. This is the backdrop against which we started exploring Kubeflow to provide advanced orchestration, experimentation, and other services. . Kubeflow and Istio . Our first challenge with running Kubeflow was the compatibility of Kubeflow’s Istio with Intuit’s existing Service Mesh built on top of Istio. Two key problems emerged: version compatibility and operational maintenance. . Kubeflow v1.3 defaults to Istio (v1.9), and luckily it is compatible with the older versions of Istio (v1.6), which is what Intuit runs on. Running two Istio versions is impractical, as that would defeat the benefit of a large, interconnected existing service mesh. Hence, we wanted Kubeflow to work seamlessly with Intuit’s service mesh running Istio v1.6. . If you are new to Istio, you might want a primer on these key Traffic Management Components and Security Components: . VirtualService | DestinationRule | Gateway | EnvoyFilter | AuthorizationPolicy | Step 1: Remove default Istio configurations and Argo from Kubeflow . The first step to running Kubeflow was to remove the Istio and Argo bundled with Kubeflow so that it could be integrated with the Intuit service mesh. . To Remove Kubeflow’s default Istio . We have used Kustomize to build the manifest we need for our Kubeflow installation and we are using ArgoCD to deploy the Kubeflow Kubernetes manifests. . . ├── base # Base folder for the kubeflow out of the box manifests │ ├── kustomization.yaml │ ├── pipelines # Folder for Kubeflow Pipelines module │ │ ├── kustomization.yaml │ ├── other modules # Similar to the Pipelines module you can bring other modules as well │ ├── kustomization.yaml ├── envs # Folder for all the Kubeflow environments │ ├── prod │ │ ├── kustomization.yaml │ ├── dev │ ├── kustomization.yaml . base -&gt; kustomization.yaml . apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: Kustomization resources: - github.com/kubeflow/manifests/common/kubeflow-roles/base?ref=v1.3.0 - github.com/kubeflow/manifests/common/kubeflow-namespace/base?ref=v1.3.0 - github.com/kubeflow/manifests/common/oidc-authservice/base?ref=v1.3.0 - github.com/kubeflow/manifests/apps/admission-webhook/upstream/overlays/cert-manager?ref=v1.3.0 - github.com/kubeflow/manifests/apps/profiles/upstream/overlays/kubeflow?ref=v1.3.0 - github.com/kubeflow/manifests/apps/centraldashboard/upstream/overlays/istio?ref=v1.3.0 - pipelines . base -&gt; pipelines -&gt; kustomization.yaml . apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: Kustomization bases: - github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/manifests/kustomize/base/installs/multi-user?ref=1.5.0 - github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/manifests/kustomize/base/metadata/base?ref=1.5.0 - github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/manifests/kustomize/base/metadata/options/istio?ref=1.5.0 # To remove the default Argo from Pipelines module # - github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/manifests/kustomize/third-party/argo/installs/cluster?ref=1.5.0 - github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/manifests/kustomize/third-party/mysql/base?ref=1.5.0 - github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/manifests/kustomize/third-party/mysql/options/istio?ref=1.5.0 - github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/manifests/kustomize/third-party/minio/base?ref=1.5.0 - github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/manifests/kustomize/third-party/minio/options/istio?ref=1.5.0 - github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/manifests/kustomize/third-party/metacontroller/base?ref=1.5.0 # Identifier for application manager to apply ownerReference. # The ownerReference ensures the resources get garbage collected # when application is deleted. commonLabels: application-crd-id: kubeflow-pipelines # !!! If you want to customize the namespace, # please also update base/cache-deployer/cluster-scoped/cache-deployer-clusterrolebinding.yaml namespace: kubeflow . Note: we had to create a separate folder for pipelines because we didn’t want to use Argo, which comes with the Pipelines module. If you can use default Argo, then you can simply use https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/apps/pipeline/upstream/env/platform-agnostic-multi-user-pns?ref=v1.3.0 instead of the pipelines folder. . If you don’t want to use ArgoCD, you can build the manifest using the kustomize build command, which is essentially what ArgoCD does. The configuration above has been tested for Kustomize 3.8.x and 4.0.x, and it works with both. . Step 2: Kustomize the Kubeflow manifests . Given the managed Kubernetes ecosystem at Intuit, protocols for service to service communication and namespace isolation is opinionated, and we had to make the following changes: . Enable Kubeflow namespace for Istio injection by adding the label istio-injection: enabled in the namespace specification. This label is then used by Istio to add the sidecar into the namespace. | Enable sidecar injection to all the deployments and statefulsets in Kubeflow by adding the annotation sidecar.istio.io/inject: &quot;true&quot;, along with some Intuit-specific custom labels and annotations to the Deployments and StatefulSets. | Intuit’s security policies forbid the direct use of external container registries. Intuit’s internal container registry runs regular vulnerability scans and certifies Docker images for use in various environments. The internal container registry also has an allow list that enables external registries to be proxied and held to the same, high-security standards. We enabled it for all Kubeflow containers. | Changes in VirtualService to route all the traffic from one central gateway instead of using Kubeflow gateway. | We have used Kustomize to modify the Kubeflow application manifest. . For adding labels, we have used LabelTransformer apiVersion: builtin kind: LabelTransformer metadata: name: deployment-labels labels: &lt;Intuit custom labels&gt; istio-injected: &quot;true&quot; fieldSpecs: - path: spec/template/metadata/labels kind: Deployment create: true - path: spec/template/metadata/labels kind: StatefulSet create: true . | For adding annotations, we have used AnnotationsTransformer . apiVersion: builtin kind: AnnotationsTransformer metadata: name: deployment-annotations annotations: &lt;Intuit custom annotations&gt; sidecar.istio.io/inject: &quot;true&quot; fieldSpecs: - path: spec/template/metadata/annotations kind: Deployment create: true - path: spec/template/metadata/annotations kind: StatefulSet create: true . | For replacing docker image URLs, we used ImageTagTransformer . apiVersion: builtin kind: ImageTagTransformer metadata: name: image-transformer-1 imageTag: name: gcr.io/ml-pipeline/cache-deployer newName: docker.intuit.com/gcr-rmt/ml-pipeline/cache-deployer . It will be helpful for any organization which has a proxy for accessing the internet, cloning all the container images local to your org is the way to go as the internet will not be required to access those images. . | For transforming VirtualServices . - op: remove path: /spec/hosts/0 - op: replace path: /spec/gateways/0 value: &lt;custom gateway&gt; - op: add path: /spec/hosts/0 value: &lt;kubflow host name&gt; - op: add path: /spec/exportTo value: [&quot;.&quot;] . | Putting it all together . envs -&gt; prod/dev -&gt; kustomization.yaml . apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: Kustomization resources: - ../base transformers: - transformers/image-transformers.yaml - transformers/label-transformers.yaml - transformers/annotations-transformers.yaml patchesJson6902: # patch VirtualService with explicit host # add multiple targets like below for all the VirtualServices which you need - path: patches/virtual-service-hosts.yaml target: group: networking.istio.io version: v1alpha3 kind: VirtualService name: centraldashboard . | You might face issues with the metadata_envoy service, in our case we were getting the following error [debug][init] [external/envoy/source/common/init/watcher_impl.cc:27] init manager Server destroyed unable to bind domain socket with id=0 (see --base-id option) 2021-01-29T23:32:26.680310Z error Epoch 0 exited with error: exit status 1 . After looking up, we found that, when you run this docker image with Istio Sidecar injection, this problem occurs. The reason is, both these containers are essentially envoyproxy containers and the default base-id for both containers is set to 0. . So to make it work, we had to change CMD in this Dockerfile . CMD [&quot;/etc/envoy.yaml&quot;, &quot;--base-id&quot;, &quot;1&quot;] . | Step 3: Custom changes needed for SSO . There are two major components around authentication using SSO: . Authservice: It is a StatefulSet that runs the oidc-auth service. It runs in the istio-system namespace and directly talks to an OIDC service for authentication | Authn-filter: It’s an EnvoyFilter that filters the traffic to authservice and checks the Kubeflow auth header and redirects to authservice if the request is not authorized, check the presence of header called kubeflow-userid | Note: Intuit SSO supports OIDC, so we did not need to use dex for the integration. If your org’s SSO does not support OIDC, then you can use dex in the middle; details can be found here. . For our installation, we needed the authservice to be mesh-enabled, and it made more sense to move authservice to the kubeflow namespace as well, which was already enabled for Istio sidecar injection. . After enabling Istio mesh on authservice, some more changes were required in the default manifest for it to work. The authservice pod was not able to communicate with the Intuit SSO HTTPS URL, because outbound traffic from the main container pod is intercepted by Istio sidecar to enforce mtls (default behavior). So, we had to exclude the HTTPS port (443) to disable mtls. This can be done using the annotation traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundPorts: &quot;443&quot;. . Step 4: Setting up ingress . We exposed the istio-ingressgateway service as LoadBalancer using the following mechanism: . Setting up public hosted zone in Route 53, add hostname you would like to use, like example.com | Setting up an ACM certificate for the hostname you want to use for the Kubeflow installation, the hostname can be kubeflow.example.com | Updating the service manifest by adding a few annotations: # Note that the backend talks over HTTP. service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: http # TODO: Fill in with the ARN of your certificate. service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert: &lt;cert arn from step 2&gt; service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-security-groups: &lt;to restrict access within org&gt; # Only run SSL on the port named &quot;https&quot; below. service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-ports: &quot;https&quot; external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: kubeflow.example.com . | After applying the new manifest, AWS will automatically add the appropriate A and TXT entries in your hosted zone (example.com) and Kubeflow will be accessible at kubeflow.example.com. . To secure the Gateway with https, you can also change the gateway port and add the key and certificate in the Gateway. . More about these annotations can be found at Terminate HTTPS traffic on Amazon EKS and SSL support on AWS blog. . Step 5: Using an external Argo installation . Kubfelow uses Argo workflows internally to run the pipeline in a workflow fashion. Argo generates artifacts after the workflow steps and all we need to do is configure the artifact store if we are planning to use the external Argo: . Install Argo workflows in your cluster, it gets installed in a namespace called argo. | Remove all the Argo-related manifests from Kubeflow. | To override the artifact store, you need to change the ConfigMap workflow-controller-configmap which comes with the Kubeflow manifest. It uses minio as the store but you can configure it to use S3 as well. More details can be found from the ArgoWorkflow Controller Configmap GitHub page. | The latest version of Argo has the option to override artifact store for namespace as well. | Debugging tricks . Check if EnvoyFilter is getting applied: you should have the istioctl cmd tool: . istioctl proxy-config listeners &lt;pod name&gt; --port 15001 -o json . See if the envoy filter is getting listed in the output. More about Istio proxy debugging can be found here. . | Check istio-ingressgateway: . # Port forward to the first istio-ingressgateway pod kubectl -n istio-system port-forward $(kubectl -n istio-system get pods -listio=ingressgateway -o=jsonpath=&quot;{.items[0].metadata.name}&quot;) 15000 # Get the http routes from the port-forwarded ingressgateway pod (requires jq) curl --silent http://localhost:15000/config_dump | jq &#39; &#39;&#39;.configs.routes.dynamic_route_configs[].route_config.virtual_hosts[]| {name: .name, domains: .domains, route: .routes[].match.prefix}&#39; &#39;&#39; # Get the logs of the first istio-ingressgateway pod # Shows what happens with incoming requests and possible errors kubectl -n istio-system logs $(kubectl -n istio-system get pods -listio=ingressgateway -o=jsonpath=&quot;{.items[0].metadata.name}&quot;) --tail=300 # Get the logs of the first istio-pilot pod # Shows issues with configurations or connecting to the Envoy proxies kubectl -n istio-system logs $(kubectl -n istio-system get pods -listio=pilot -o=jsonpath=&quot;{.items[0].metadata.name}&quot;) discovery --tail=300 . | Check the authservice connectivity: istio-ingressgateway pod should be able to access authservice. You can check that using the following command: . kubectl -n istio-system exec $(kubectl -n istio-system get pods -listio=pilot -o=jsonpath=&quot;{.items[0].metadata.name}&quot;) -- curl -v http://authservice.istio-system.svc.cluster.local:8080 . Also, make sure authservice can reach dex: . In our case, authservice is in the kubeflow namespace so we made changes accordingly using the command below: . kubectl -n kubeflow exec authservice-0 -- wget -q -S -O &#39;-&#39; &lt;oidc auth url&gt;/.well-known/openid-configuration . It should look something similar to: . { &quot;issuer&quot;: &quot;http://dex.kubeflow.svc.cluster.local:5556/dex&quot;, &quot;authorization_endpoint&quot;: &quot;http://dex.kubeflow.svc.cluster.local:5556/dex/auth&quot;, &quot;token_endpoint&quot;: &quot;http://dex.kubeflow.svc.cluster.local:5556/dex/token&quot;, &quot;jwks_uri&quot;: &quot;http://dex.kubeflow.svc.cluster.local:5556/dex/keys&quot;, &quot;userinfo_endpoint&quot;: &quot;http://dex.kubeflow.svc.cluster.local:5556/dex/userinfo&quot;, &quot;response_types_supported&quot;: [ &quot;code&quot; ], &quot;subject_types_supported&quot;: [ &quot;public&quot; ], &quot;id_token_signing_alg_values_supported&quot;: [ &quot;RS256&quot; ], &quot;scopes_supported&quot;: [ &quot;openid&quot;, &quot;email&quot;, &quot;groups&quot;, &quot;profile&quot;, &quot;offline_access&quot; ], &quot;token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported&quot;: [ &quot;client_secret_basic&quot; ], &quot;claims_supported&quot;: [ &quot;aud&quot;, &quot;email&quot;, &quot;email_verified&quot;, &quot;exp&quot;, &quot;iat&quot;, &quot;iss&quot;, &quot;locale&quot;, &quot;name&quot;, &quot;sub&quot; ] } . | Check connectivity between services: try using curl or wget from one service to another. Usually one or the other is always available, otherwise, you can always install using the apt-get command. Example use case: from the ml-pipeline deployment pod you can check if pipeline APIs are accessible. . kubectl -n kubeflow exec $(kubectl -n kubeflow get pods -lapp=ml-pipeline-ui -o=jsonpath=&quot;{.items[0].metadata.name}&quot;) -- wget -q -S -O &#39;-&#39; ml-pipeline.kubeflow.svc.cluster.local:8888/apis/v1beta1/pipelines . | Asks for the Kubeflow Community . The challenges that we encountered at Intuit are not unique and will be faced by any enterprise that wants to adopt Kubeflow. . It would be nice to have Kubeflow play well with the available Kubernetes infrastructure in an enterprise, rather than mandating its own set of infrastructure. Here are some suggestions/bugs for improving the ecosystem, some of which Intuit will work with the community to build out: . We saw Kubeflow manifest repo went through major folder restructuring for v1.3 but we think there is still room for improvements. | Multi-Cluster / Multi-Region support. #5467 | Upgrade seems to be an issue in general, should figure out a way to manage this better. #5440 | Multi-tenancy with group support. #4188 | Installing Kubeflow in any custom namespace. #5647 | Existing metadata service is not performant, we did try some settings with more resources and horizontal scaling.

            "title": "The Kubeflow 1.3 software release streamlines ML workflows and simplifies ML platform operations",
            "content": "The Kubeflow 1.3 release delivers simplified ML workflows and additional Kubernetes integrated features to optimize operational and infrastructure efficiencies. In addition to new User Interfaces (UIs), which improve ML workflows for pipeline building, model tuning, serving and monitoring, 1.3 also enables “headless” GitOps-inspired installation patterns. The latest version of Kubeflow provides users with a mature foundation and delivers a modern ML platform with best-in-class Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). . The Kubeflow user community is growing quickly, which was demonstrated in our recent survey results. When compared to last year’s survey, the 2021 Survey showed a 50% increase in responses and a whopping 300% increase in users supporting production deployments. As shown below, the user survey responses, especially from ML engineers, architects and data scientists, have identified where the Kubeflow contributors should focus their efforts. . Kubeflow User Survey Results - March 2021 . . Streamlined ML workflows delivered via new UIs . Data scientists will like the new and updated user interfaces (UIs) for Katib, TensorBoard, Persistent Volumes, Pipelines and Kale. These new UIs address many of the ML tasks that are time consuming and technically challenging. The UIs reduce the need for a data scientist to learn kfctl or docker CLI commands. . Below please find details on the UIs’ benefits for ML workflows: . Katib (Video Tour) The Katib UI is integrated with the central dashboard and streamlines hyperparameter tuning by presenting a visualization graph and a table that compares each trial’s performance along with its hyperparameters. You can also review the details of each trial’s algorithm, metrics collector and yaml. (Project 1) | . | TensorBoard (Video tour) The TensorBoard UI streamlines the TensorBoard configuration tasks, especially for logging of training jobs which are running in Notebooks or Pipelines. It simplifies accessibility to metrics, which helps you to improve model accuracy , identify performance bottlenecks, and reduce unproductive training jobs. | . | Volume Manager (Video tour) The Volume Manager enables you to manage your data and persistent volumes. For the volumes in your namespace, it streamlines the creation and deletion of volumes, which then can be easily attached to your notebooks. PR 5684 | . | Kale (Video tour) The updated Kale UI, a JupyterLab extension, simplifies your hyperparameter tuning trial set-up. The UI walks you through these steps: enter your hyperparameters as a list or a range, pick your search algorithm (Grid, Random, Bayesian) and the parameter to be optimized i.e. minimize loss. Then with a click of a button, your Katib trials are set-up, snapshotted, tracked, and run. | . | Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) The KFP UI has been reorganized for a more unified experience (PR 4925), and includes the ability to manage recurring runs via new “JobsList” and “AllJobslist” pages (PR 5131) and simplified view of dependency graphs. | . | . Beyond the UIs, data scientists can also tie Notebooks with Serving more closely than ever before. In addition to the aforementioned integration with TensorBoard, Kubeflow Notebooks also now support first class deployments with TensorFlow 2.0, PyTorch, VS Code and RStudio. . KFServing enhancements include simplified canary rollouts with traffic splitting at the Knative revisions level. It also delivers extended ML framework support for: . TorchServe predict and PyTorch Captum Explain | PMMLServer, PR 1141 | LightGBM | . Infrastructure and operational efficiencies .

            "content": "Kubeflow Users are maturing and the community is growing, forty eight percent of users are supporting deployments in production. . The Spring 2021 Kubeflow Community User Survey collected input from Kubeflow users on the benefits, gaps and requirements for machine learning use cases. It is the largest survey to date with 179 responses—a 50% increase from the Kubeflow 1.0 Community User Survey a year ago. The Survey respondents span a spectrum of skill sets. While 42% are machine learning (ML) engineers, and 24% are ML architects, the titles of the respondents vary from DevOps Engineers to data scientists and product managers. . . Kubeflow Continues to Move Into Production . Forty eight percent of users are supporting deployments that are in production, up from 15% last year. Further, one question that many folks have is “do people upgrade a production deployment or just install a new cluster and start over?” It appears that the latter is far more common: just 8% have upgraded their environment. . . Similar to previous years, Kubeflow Pipelines and Notebooks are the most popular components, but other components are now being widely deployed as well. Interest in TensorBoard has grown, joining KFServing, Katib (AutoML), and Distributed Training as top additional services. . . Although the usage patterns for Kubeflow components are mixed, the vast majority of users need at least two Kubeflow components in their ML Platform. . . TensorFlow is the leading ML Framework, followed by Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Keras, and XGBoost. However, with Kubeflow’s built-in extensibility, the type of ML tools people use in Kubeflow go beyond just training frameworks, and include MLFlow, Airflow, and Spark. . .

From a gap perspective, the users would like improved documentation, tutorials, and installation, along with more automation, support and security. . . Using Kubeflow Goes Beyond Just Training . Users identified that data preprocessing and transformation are both the most time consuming and challenging steps. We also received feedback that pipeline building and feature engineering are both time consuming and challenging. Distributed training, model serving and monitoring appear to be more technically challenging than time consuming. . . ML model delivery commonly requires multiple teams to work together i.e. data engineers, data scientists, ML engineers and devops engineers. ML workflows often include manual processes and there can be gaps in the handoffs between these groups. In particular, connecting data pipelines to ML pipelines is an example of a process that could be better automated, along with pipeline building and model monitoring. . . The vast majority of Kubeflow users are self-reliant in solving complex problems: . . And many are using tutorials created by Cloud Service Providers (i.e. Google, AWS and Azure) and MiniKF from Arrikto. . . The majority of ML models have a fairly short life: ~50% run in production for 3 months or less. On the other end of the spectrum, 25% of the models remain in production for 6 months or longer. . . And ~70% of all models take up to 15 iterations to produce a final model suitable for production. . . Users have a wide range of success with their models: ~43% are getting more than half of their models to deliver business value. On the other side, 39% are getting a very small percentage (10%) of their models into production and delivering business value. . . User Requests . We provided a section for free-form responses and we received a great deal of feedback. Here are some good examples of user requests: . Metadata storage and versioning | More robust access control and permission granularity for model/data sharing | More visibility on your roadmap | Installation patterns, stability, multi tenancy | More real life case studies | Updated and more in-depth documentation | . Key Takeaways . In addition to learning about how users are operating Kubeflow in production clusters, the Community Survey has given us important data that we can use to enhance our processes: . Improvements to the release management process, which is being driven by better inter-Working Group collaboration. This, coupled with core upgrades to Istio and a clean-up of the installation manifests, will improve the testing, documentation, and installation patterns. | Automation of pipeline building and feature engineering tasks, especially with continued integrations of Kubeflow with Kale and Feast, which are enabling new end-to-end workflows and tutorials. | Enhancements for data preprocessing and transformation as well as streamlined connections of Data Pipelines to ML Pipelines. Additionally, a renewed effort to develop a Spark operator. | Several new UIs are under development i.e. Katib, Model Management, Volumes Management and TensorBoard Management, which will help the user experience. | .

            "title": "Elastic Training with MPI Operator and Practice",
            "content": "With increase in the size of dataset and deep learning models, distributed training emerges as the mainstream approach for training neural network models in industry. While it is feasible now to launch a massive distributed training job on Kubernetes with Kubeflow, advanced features like elastic workload and other cost mitigation approaches remain leashed when we talk about deep learning jobs on Kubernetes. . To address issues on cost and resource utilization, the TKE (Tencent Kubernetes Engine) AI team designs and implements Elastic Training in Kubeflow community. . Here we present how the elastic training is performed on Kubernetes. Validated with experiments under circumstances, elastic training lowers cost for distributed training on cloud. . Background . Let’s first recap training deep learning models. When we talk about ‘training’, it refers generally to iteratively optimizing parameters in a neural network model with its gradient descent. Accelerated with GPUs, the training can speed up for 10-100 times. . When manufacturers try to integrate more computational resources like GPUs into a single machine, to hold training experiments with more and more data or model parameters, the cost grows exponentially. Therefore, after initially proposed by Mu Li on OSDI’14, distributed training takes over training on a single machine when researchers play with massive dataset or large model. . For distributed training in data-parallelism, Horovod is widely adopted given its excellent support on deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, communication optimization and easier programming pattern. In Horovod, all training processes are equal participants, each of which process the gradient calculation and communication. . . Because of significant acceleration of training speed as well as the programming pattern that are easier to understand, data-parallelism distributed training, represented by Horovod, is getting more and more attention. However, there still remain some issues: . The cost of training on the cloud is still the hurdle. While researchers no longer face the complexity when training on cloud thanks to Kubernetes and Kubeflow, the cost of training on cloud quells some users. | Compared with training on a single machine, multi-node distributed training accumulates the probability of training failure. The entire training experiment fails when any of its training process issues an error. This problem becomes even severer when some experiments take days or even weeks. | When collocating training tasks with other workloads (with higher priority), the resources demand fluctuates as the request for these other workloads may change periodically. This unbalance of resources availability throws cold water on the idea of using hybrid-deployment to maximize resource utilization. | . Elastic Training . Researchers and engineers proposed Elastic Training as the key to solve the puzzle. . Traditionally, the resource configuration for a distributed training job is fixed. Elastic training breaks this rule and enables users to change the number of instances participating in a distributed training job, bringing the following benefits to clusters with distributed training jobs: . Fault Tolerance: any worker instance can fail as long as at least one is surviving. | Resources Utilization: when the resources stress piles, the cluster is able to reduce the replicas of workloads with lower priority (distributed training workloads), releasing resource to other workloads (such as prediction service), ensuring SLA for business; after resources released from workloads, elastic training job is able to absorb these resource by scaling up workload replicas. | Training on Cloud: there is a type of resource on the cloud that is called “spot” or “preemptible” instances; it comes with unexpected low price tags but may be retrieved after guaranteed hour expires. | . Elastic training appears a perfect match to public cloud. Combined with spot instances, we cut the cost for GPUs from ¥16.21/hour to ¥1.62/hour, reducing the overall cost for the training job by nearly 70%. Under the same budget, elastic training employs more GPUs and accelerates the training speed by 5 to 10 times. . Elastic Horovod . As the major player in distributed training framework, Horovod v0.20.0 offers its solution to elastic training, Elastic Horovod. Here we quotes the architecture differences between Elastic Horovod and existing Horovod from RFC Elastic Horovod: . . All collective operations are coordinated within a hvd.elastic.run function. | State is synchronized between workers before the user’s training function is executed. | Worker failure or worker added events will result in a reset event on other workers. | Reset events act as barriers to: Determine whether the job should continue based on worker exit codes. | Blacklist failing hosts. | Launch workers on new hosts. | Update the rank information on existing workers. | . | State is synchronized following a reset event. | . When launching an elastic training job, horovodrun requires a discover_hosts.sh script to detect available hosts and slots in real time. In the following section, we refer this script as discover_hosts.sh. Nevertheless the script needs not to be named as discover_hosts.sh. An example of discover_hosts.sh can be found here. . Elastic Horovod on Kubernetes . MPI-Operator is designed to deploy Horovod jobs on Kubernetes. While the operator releases multiple versions, the general idea stays unchanged. It includes: . . MPIJob Controller creates a launcher pod and worker pods according to the replicas configuration in MPIJobs | For each MPIJob, the controller creates a ConfigMap, which delivers two files: hostfile and kubexec.sh | With all worker pods ready, mpirun on launcher pod (granted with pod/exec permission) uses kubexec.sh to launch processes on worker pods | . Launching an Elastic Horovod job is not feasible as there exist several incompatibilities between Elastic Horovod and MPIJob Controller. We take controller-v1 as the example: . No built-in discover_hosts.sh available on launcher pod | After worker replica number is turned down, worker pods that are no longer wanted will not be deleted by the controller, leaving the size of the distributed training unchanged | After worker replica number is turned up, the controller does not update rule in the Role binded to the launcher pod, preventing the launcher pod from creating processes on newly created pods | . To address these compatibility issues, we pushed multiple pull requests regarding Horovod and MPI-Operator, including mpi-operator-pull-335 and horovod-pull-2199. As providing an MPI-Operator-specific discover_hosts.sh is most critical to the launcher pod for Elastic Horovod, we consider two scenarios for converting worker pods with a Running phase into a discover_hosts.sh script. . A dynamic discover_hosts.sh composed by MPIJob controller and synchronized to the launcher pod via ConfigMap MPIJob controller has a podLister, which can be used to list worker pods readily | the controller filters worker pods with status.phase == Running and encode the result into the discover_hosts.sh | the ConfigMap is updated when discover_hosts.sh is modified and the change will be propagated to the launcher pod by Kubernetes | . | A static discover_hosts.sh using kubectl in the launcher pod to list all running worker pods from APIServer | . Scenario 2 changes the delivery image instead of the controller. However, as we cannot limit how frequently users will execute the discover_hosts.sh script, it poses a potential threat to the APIServer, especially when the count of worker pods is massive. . An fixture to scenario 2 is to replace the kubectl with a podLister process, removing extra stress from the APIServer. In this way, we install two processes in launcher pod but lack a proper mechanism to keep the podLister alive. Once the podLister dies, there leaves no elasticity for the training job. . Therefore we choose the first scenario and map the disocver_hosts.sh under /etc/mpi/. We also fixed the other compatibility issues after the worker replica configuration changes. For users choose non-elastic mode, just simply ignore /etc/mpi/discover_hosts.sh. . Concerns comes to scenario 1 as well. There is a delay between the ConfigMap and what horovodrun sees from the discover_hosts.sh in the launcher pod. This delay, on one hand, can be tweaked by cluster admin and on the other hand, can be considered as tiny compared to the training elapsed time or the time for Elastic Horovod to handle worker changes. . Demo . We present a demo to show how to operate an Elastic Horovod job with MPI Operator. . bash-5.0$ kubectl create -f ./tensorflow-mnist-elastic.yaml mpijob.kubeflow.org/tensorflow-mnist-elastic createdbash-5.0$ kubectl get po NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE tensorflow-mnist-elastic-launcher 1/1 Running 0 14s tensorflow-mnist-elastic-worker-0 1/1 Running 0 14s tensorflow-mnist-elastic-worker-1 1/1 Running 0 14s . The job is created with two workers. After the training begins, we change MPIJob.Spec.MPIReplicaSpecs[&quot;Worker&quot;].Replicas to 3, adding another worker. Let’s check how the discover_hosts.sh changes: . bash-5.0$ kubectl exec tensorflow-mnist-elastic-launcher -- /etc/mpi/discover_hosts.sh tensorflow-mnist-elastic-worker-0:1 tensorflow-mnist-elastic-worker-1:1 bash-5.0$ cat ./patch_r3.yaml spec: mpiReplicaSpecs: &quot;Worker&quot;: replicas: 3 bash-5.0$ kubectl patch mpijob tensorflow-mnist-elastic --patch &quot;$(cat patch_r3.yaml)&quot; --type=merge mpijob.kubeflow.org/tensorflow-mnist-elastic patched bash-5.0$ kubectl exec tensorflow-mnist-elastic-launcher -- /etc/mpi/discover_hosts.sh tensorflow-mnist-elastic-worker-0:1 tensorflow-mnist-elastic-worker-1:1 tensorflow-mnist-elastic-worker-2:1 . We reduce the replica count to 1, retrieving 2 worker instances. . bash-5.0$ cat ./patch_r1.yaml spec: mpiReplicaSpecs: &quot;Worker&quot;: replicas: 1 bash-5.0$ kubectl patch mpijob tensorflow-mnist-elastic --patch &quot;$(cat patch_r1.yaml)&quot; --type=merge mpijob.kubeflow.org/tensorflow-mnist-elastic patched bash-5.0$ kubectl get po NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE tensorflow-mnist-elastic-launcher 1/1 Running 0 4m48s tensorflow-mnist-elastic-worker-0 1/1 Running 0 4m48s tensorflow-mnist-elastic-worker-1 1/1 Terminating 0 4m48s tensorflow-mnist-elastic-worker-2 1/1 Terminating 0 2m21s .

As we can see, Elastic Horovod on MPI-Operator now supports tweaking worker replicas dynamically. As a future work, we aim to support Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to MPIJob as well as other features like designated worker deletion. . Conclusion . When the concept of cloud native and distributed training fuse to elastic training on Kubernetes, it lowers the cost and gives robustness and flexibility. As a team, we are working with PyTorch, Horovod and other communities to propel elastic training. We wish to further introduce our work on elasticity with PS/Worker training mode, optimization for resource and job priority and other topics on cloud native AI. .",

            "title": "Kubeflow Katib: Scalable, Portable and Cloud Native System for AutoML",
            "content": "As machine learning (ML) architectures are increasing in complexity, it is becoming important to find the optimal hyperparameters and architecture for ML models. Automated machine learning (AutoML) has become a crucial step in the ML lifecycle. Katib provides AutoML features in Kubeflow in a Kubernetes native way. . Katib is an open source project which is agnostic to ML frameworks. It can tune hyperparameters in applications written in any language of the user’s choice and natively supports many ML frameworks, such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, MPI, MXNet, XGBoost, scikit-learn, and others. Katib improves business results by efficiently building more accurate models and lowering operational and infrastructure costs. Katib can be deployed on local machines, or hosted as a service in on-premise data centers, or in private/public clouds. . Katib offers a rich set of features accessible via APIs. By using these APIs, Katib is natively integrated to Kubeflow Notebooks and Pipelines. Katib supports Hyperparameter optimization (HP), Neural Architecture Search (NAS), and Early Stopping. Early Stopping feature can be used without any significant changes in the current Katib Experiments. . Furthermore, Katib is a unique system which supports all Kubernetes workloads and Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) to perform Katib Experiments. Since Katib can execute various Kubernetes resources, users are able to run not only ML models optimization Experiments. They can also enhance any software, code or program to make it more efficient with optimization algorithms provided by Katib. . We are continually working on the new Katib UI to provide a better User Experience and native integration with Kubeflow central dashboard. Please check this presentation to know more about the new UI. . All of the above mentioned features allow users to easily integrate Katib in their ML infrastructure pipeline. . System Architecture . . There are 3 main concepts in Katib which are Kubernetes CRDs: . Experiment - a single optimization run with objective, search space, and search algorithm. . | Suggestion - set of hyperparameters, which are produced by a user’s selected search algorithm. Katib creates Trials to evaluate them. . | Trial - one iteration of the hyperparameters tuning process. Trial runs the worker job which corresponds to the training job. Since Trial is an abstraction on top of the worker job, any Kubernetes resource can be used to perform the training job. For example, TFJob, MPIJob or even Tekton Pipeline. . | . By using above resources Katib follows the following steps, which are marked in the diagram above: . Once an Experiment is submitted, the Experiment controller creates an appropriate Suggestion object. . | The Suggestion controller creates an AutoML algorithm service based on this Suggestion object. When the algorithm service is ready, the Suggestion controller calls the service to get new parameters and appends them to the Suggestion object. . | The Experiment controller finds that Suggestion object has been updated and creates a corresponding Trial object for each set of parameters. . | The Trial controller generates a worker job for each Trial object and watches for the status of each job. The worker job based on the Trial template. . | Once the worker job has been completed, the metrics collector gets the metrics from the job and persists them in the database. . | The Experiment controller sends the metrics results to the algorithm service and gets new parameters from the Suggestion object. . | Custom Kubernetes resources support . Katib version 0.10 implements a new feature to support any Kubernetes CRDs or Kubernetes workloads as a Katib Trial template. Therefore, there is no need to manually modify the Katib controller to use CRD as a Trial. As long as the CRD creates Kubernetes Pods, allows injecting the sidecar container on these Pods, and has success and failure status, the CRD can be used in Katib. . Here are the motivations behind this feature: . Katib Trial template supports only a limited type of Kubernetes resource (BatchJob, TFJob and PyTorchJob). . | Many Katib users might have their own CRDs which they want to use as a Trial template. Thus, the approach of updating the Katib controller for the new CRD is not scalable. . | Some CRDs might have Go packages versions which are incompatible with the Katib controller packages. For such cases, it is impossible to build a Katib controller image. . | Users have to build and maintain a custom image version for the Katib controller if they want to implement a new CRD in Katib. . | . The above problems led to the creation of a scalable and portable solution for the Trial template. This solution allows users to modify Katib components and to add their CRDs without changing the Katib controller image. . Katib now supports Tekton Pipeline and MPIJob in addition to BatchJob, TFJob and PyTorchJob. In the case of Tekton Pipeline, a user is able to build a complex workflow inside the Trial’s worker job. The user also can implement data preprocessing and postprocessing with all of the Tekton Pipeline features. Eventually, Katib’s metrics collector parses and saves the appropriate metrics from the training processes to the database. . Support new Kubernetes CRD in Katib . To support new Kubernetes CRD, Katib components need to be modified before installing in the Kubernetes cluster. To make this modification, it is necessary to know: . what API group, version, and kind the Kubernetes CRD has, and . | which Kubernetes resources the CRD’s controller creates. . | . Check the Kubernetes guide to know more about CRDs. . Follow these two simple steps to integrate new CRD in Katib: . Modify the Katib controller Deployment’s arguments with the new flag: . --trial-resources=&lt;object-kind&gt;.&lt;object-API-version&gt;.&lt;object-API-group&gt; . For example, to support Tekton Pipeline: . . . . containers: - name: katib-controller image: docker.io/kubeflowkatib/katib-controller command: [&quot;./katib-controller&quot;] args: - &quot;--webhook-port=8443&quot; - &quot;--trial-resources=Job.v1.batch&quot; - &quot;--trial-resources=TFJob.v1.kubeflow.org&quot; - &quot;--trial-resources=PyTorchJob.v1.kubeflow.org&quot; - &quot;--trial-resources=MPIJob.v1.kubeflow.org&quot; - &quot;--trial-resources=PipelineRun.v1beta1.tekton.dev&quot; . . . . | Modify the Katib controller ClusterRole’s rules with the new rule to give Katib an access to all Kubernetes resources that are created by the CRD’s controller. To know more about ClusterRole, please check the Kubernetes guide. . For example, for the Tekton Pipeline, Trial creates Tekton PipelineRun, then Tekton PipelineRun creates Tekton TaskRun. Therefore, Katib controller ClusterRole should have an access to the pipelineruns and taskruns: . kind: ClusterRole apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 metadata: name: katib-controller rules: - apiGroups: - tekton.dev resources: - pipelineruns - taskruns verbs: - &quot;*&quot; - apiGroups: - kubeflow.org resources: - tfjobs - pytorchjobs - mpijobs verbs: - &quot;*&quot; . . . . | Install Katib by following the getting started guide. . | At this point, the Kubernetes CRD can be used in the Katib Trial template. Check this guide to know more about Tekton and Katib integration. . Early Stopping . Early Stopping is now supported in the Katib 0.10 release. Early Stopping is one of the essential steps for doing HP tuning. It helps to avoid overfitting when the model is training during Katib Experiments. . Using Early Stopping helps to save compute resources and to reduce the Experiment execution time by stopping the Experiment’s Trials when the target metric(s) no longer improves before the training process is complete. . The major advantage of using Early Stopping in Katib is that the training container package doesn’t need to be modified. Basically, the Experiment’s YAML has to be extended with the new entity - earlyStopping, which is similar to the algorithm YAML section: . apiVersion: &quot;kubeflow.org/v1beta1&quot; kind: Experiment metadata: namespace: kubeflow name: median-stop spec: algorithm: algorithmName: random earlyStopping: algorithmName: medianstop algorithmSettings: - name: min_trials_required value: &quot;3&quot; - name: start_step value: &quot;5&quot; objective: type: maximize goal: 0.99 objectiveMetricName: Validation-accuracy additionalMetricNames: - Train-accuracy parallelTrialCount: 2 maxTrialCount: 15 maxFailedTrialCount: 3 . . . . Currently, Katib supports the Median Stopping Rule. The Medium Stopping rule stops a running Trial at the step S if the Trial’s best objective value is lower than the median value of all succeeded Trials’ objectives reported up to that step S. Readers interested in learning more about the Median Stopping Rule can check the Google Vizier: A Service for Black-Box Optimization paper. . To know more about using Early Stopping in Katib please follow the official guide. . Getting Involved .

            "title": "Operationalize, Scale and Infuse Trust in AI Models using KFServing",
            "content": "By Animesh Singh and Dan Sun . With inputs from : KFServing WG, including Yuzhui Liu, Tommy Li, Paul Vaneck, Andrew Butler, Srinivasan Parthasarathy etc. . Machine Learning has become a key technology in a wide range of industries and organizations. One key aspect in ML landscape is that more and more models are getting produced, but are they actually getting deployed? And if they are getting deployed, are there enough robust operational mechanisms in place to understand model predictions, and monitor for drift, accuracy, anamoly, bias etc.? One key aspect of deploying models in production is being able to monitor the predictions for various metrics, and explaining the decisions the model is making, and producing quality metrics, more so in regulated industries like finance, healthcare, government sector etc. Additionally based on those metrics do we have a technology in place to understand the metrics and take corrective actions e.g. doing canary rollouts? . KFServing, a project which originated in the Kubeflow community, has been hard at work solving production model serving use cases by providing performant, high abstraction interfaces for common ML frameworks like Tensorflow, XGBoost, ScikitLearn, PyTorch, and ONNX. It encapsulates the complexity of autoscaling, networking, health checking, and server configuration to bring cutting edge serving features like GPU Autoscaling, Scale to Zero, and Canary Rollouts to model deployments. We just released KFServing v0.5 with other various features to address the model operationalization and trust needs. Additionally, the team has been hard at work to make AI explainability a core construct of the deployed models, by integrating with various industry leading technologies. . KFServing Beta API and V2 (next gen) Inference Protocol . KFServing 0.5 has promoted the control plane API from v1alpha2 to stable v1beta1 and started to support the data plane V2 inference protocol. The v1beta1 control plane API enables a simple, data scientist-friendly interface, while providing the flexibility of specifying container and pod template fields for pre-packaged model servers. The V2 inference protocol pushes a standard and easy-to-use high performance REST/gRPC API across multiple model servers, such as Triton and MLServer, to increase the portability of the model ensuring the client/server can operate seamlessly. . KFServing 0.5 also introduces an optional model agent for request/response logging, request batching, and model pulling. The model agent sits alongside as a sidecar to the model server. Pre-packaged Model servers plugged onto KFServing can benefit from these common model serving features, as well as the model servers built using custom frameworks. . . What’s New? . TorchServe integration: TorchServe now is used as implementation for KFServing PyTorch model server, it also enables model explanability with Captum, see TorchServe examples here. . | Triton Inference Server V2 inference REST/gRPC protocol support, see examples of serving BERT and TorchScript models on GPUs. . | Tensorflow gRPC support. . | SKLearn/XGBoost model server now uses MLServer which supports v2 inference protocol. . | New model servers added for pmml and lightgbm. . | You can now specify container or pod template level fields on the pre-packaged model servers (e.g., env variables, readiness/liveness probes). . | Allow specifying timeouts on the component spec. . | Simplified canary rollout, you no longer need to specify both the default and canary specs on the InferenceService spec; KFServing now automatically tracks the last rolled out revision and automatically splits the traffic between the latest ready revision and last rolled out revision. . | The transformer to predictor call now defaults to using AsyncIO, which significantly improves the latency/throughput for high concurrent workload use cases. . | . KFServing Multi-Model Serving to enable massive scalability . With machine learning approaches becoming more widely adopted in organizations, there is a trend to deploy a large number of models. The original design of KFServing deploys one model per InferenceService. But when dealing with a large number of models, its ‘one model, one server’ paradigm presents challenges on a Kubernetes cluster to deploy hundreds of thousands of models. To scale the number of models, we have to scale the number of InferenceServices, something that can quickly challenge the cluster’s limits. . Multi-model serving is an alpha feature added in 0.5 to increase KFServing’s scalability. To learn more about multi-model serving motivations and implementation deatils, dive into the details in KFServing github. Please assume that the interface is subject to change. The experimental feature must be enabled from the inference service configmap. . . Multi-model serving will work with any model server that implements KFServing’s V2 protocol. More specifically, if the model server implements the load and unload endpoint, then it can use KFServing’s TrainedModel. Currently, the supported model servers are Triton, SKLearn, and XGBoost.

            "title": "Kubeflow 1.2 release announcement",
            "content": "Special Message from Kubeflow Founders . Three years (!!) ago, we (Jeremy Lewi, Vish Kannan and David Aronchick) stood on stage at Kubecon to introduce Kubeflow for the first time. We could not have possibly imagined what would have come about - thousands of GitHub stars, tens of thousands of commits and a community that has built the most flexible and scalable platform for machine learning. And, best of all, it’s not backed by an enormous company that requires you to “upgrade” in order to use it; we gave it all away for free! Here’s to everything you all have done and we could not be more excited about the NEXT three years (and the three years beyond that). Thank you! . Announcing Kubeflow v1.2 release . The Kubeflow Community’s delivery of the Kubeflow 1.2 software release includes ~100 user requested enhancements to improve model building, training, tuning, ML pipelining and serving. This post includes a Release Highlights Section, which details significant 1.2 features as contributed by the Kubeflow application working groups (WG), SIGs, and ecosystem partners. The Kubeflow 1.2 changelog provides a quick view of the 1.2 deliveries. . The Release was validated, tested and documented by the developers, and the Release is now being validated, tested and documented by users, cloud providers and commercial support partners on popular platforms i.e. AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM, etc. The Community is working on a more sustainable approach to owning and maintaining test infrastructure. . For Release 1.2, AWS has built and contributed a shared test-infra, which provides WG owners with enough permissions to identify problems, and test proposed solutions to completion. Currently, most WGs (AutoML, Training-Operators, KFServing, Deployments, Manifests) have already migrated their tests on this solution. As a result, the test-infra blocking time has fallen significantly, which is good for users and contributors. . Getting Involved . The Community continues to grow and we invite new users and contributors to join the Working Groups and Community Meetings. The following provides some helpful links to those looking to get involved with the Kubeflow Community: . Join the Kubeflow Slack channel | Join the kubeflow-discuss mailing list | Attend a Weekly Community Meeting | Review the Working Group Meeting Notes in Release Highlights Section (as the Notes include great discussions and meeting times) | . If you have questions and/or run into issues, please leverage the Kubeflow Slack channel and/or submit bugs via Kubeflow on GitHub. . What’s next . The Community has started discussions on Kubeflow 1.3. Arrikto has agreed to lead the 1.3 Release Management process and the Community will continue to capture input from users and contributors as features are defined, developed and delivered. Onward and upward! .

            "content": "The Problem . Kubeflow is a fast-growing open source project that makes it easy to deploy and manage machine learning on Kubernetes. . Due to Kubeflow’s explosive popularity, we receive a large influx of GitHub issues that must be triaged and routed to the appropriate subject matter expert. The below chart illustrates the number of new issues opened for the past year: . . Figure 1: Number of Kubeflow Issues To keep up with this influx, we started investing in a Github App called Issue Label Bot that used machine learning to auto label issues. Our first model was trained using a collection of popular public repositories on GitHub and only predicted generic labels. Subsequently, we started using Google AutoML to train a Kubeflow specific model. The new model was able to predict Kubeflow specific labels with average precision of 72% and average recall of 50%. This significantly reduced the toil associated with issue management for Kubeflow maintainers. The table below contains evaluation metrics for Kubeflow specific labels on a holdout set. The precision and recall below coincide with prediction thresholds that we calibrated to suit our needs. . Label Precision Recall . area-backend | 0.6 | 0.4 | . area-bootstrap | 0.3 | 0.1 | . area-centraldashboard | 0.6 | 0.6 | . area-components | 0.5 | 0.3 | . area-docs | 0.8 | 0.7 | . area-engprod | 0.8 | 0.5 | . area-front-end | 0.7 | 0.5 | . area-frontend | 0.7 | 0.4 | . area-inference | 0.9 | 0.5 | . area-jupyter | 0.9 | 0.7 | . area-katib | 0.8 | 1.0 | . area-kfctl | 0.8 | 0.7 | . area-kustomize | 0.3 | 0.1 | . area-operator | 0.8 | 0.7 | . area-pipelines | 0.7 | 0.4 | . area-samples | 0.5 | 0.5 | . area-sdk | 0.7 | 0.4 | . area-sdk-dsl | 0.6 | 0.4 | . area-sdk-dsl-compiler | 0.6 | 0.4 | . area-testing | 0.7 | 0.7 | . area-tfjob | 0.4 | 0.4 | . platform-aws | 0.8 | 0.5 | . platform-gcp | 0.8 | 0.6 | . Table 1: Evaluation metrics for various Kubeflow labels. Given the rate at which new issues are arriving, retraining our model periodically became a priority. We believe continuously retraining and deploying our model to leverage this new data is critical to maintaining the efficacy of our models. . Our Solution . Our CI/CD solution is illustrated in Figure 2. We don’t explicitly create a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to connect the steps in an ML workflow (e.g. preprocessing, training, validation, deployment, etc…). Rather, we use a set of independent controllers. Each controller declaratively describes the desired state of the world and takes actions necessary to make the actual state of the world match. This independence makes it easy for us to use whatever tools make the most sense for each step. More specifically we use . Jupyter notebooks for developing models. | GitOps for continuous integration and deployment. | Kubernetes and managed cloud services for underlying infrastructure. | . . Figure 2: illustrates how we do CI/CD. Our pipeline today consists of two independently operating controllers. We configure the Trainer (left hand side) by describing what models we want to exist; i.e. what it means for our models to be “fresh”. The Trainer periodically checks whether the set of trained models are sufficiently fresh and if not trains a new model. We likewise configure the Deployer (right hand side) to define what it means for the deployed model to be in sync with the set of trained models. If the correct model is not deployed it will deploy a new model. For more details on model training and deployment refer to the Actuation section below. . Background . Building Resilient Systems With Reconcilers . A reconciler is a control pattern that has proven to be immensely useful for building resilient systems. The reconcile pattern is at the heart of how Kubernetes works. Figure 3 illustrates how a reconciler works. A reconciler works by first observing the state of the world; e.g. what model is currently deployed. The reconciler then compares this against the desired state of the world and computes the diff; e.g the model with label “version=20200724” should be deployed, but the model currently deployed has label “version=20200700”. The reconciler then takes the action necessary to drive the world to the desired state; e.g. open a pull request to change the deployed model. . . Figure 3. Illustration of the reconciler pattern as applied by our deployer. Reconcilers have proven immensely useful for building resilient systems because a well implemented reconciler provides a high degree of confidence that no matter how a system is perturbed it will eventually return to the desired state. . There is no DAG . The declarative nature of controllers means data can flow through a series of controllers without needing to explicitly create a DAG. In lieu of a DAG, a series of data processing steps can instead be expressed as a set of desired states, as illustrated in Figure 4 below: . . Figure 4: illustrates how pipelines can emerge from independent controllers without explicitly encoding a DAG. Here we have two completely independent controllers. The first controller ensures that for every element ai there should be an element bi. The second controller ensures that for every element bi there should be an element ci. This reconciler-based paradigm offers the following benefits over many traditional DAG-based workflows: . Resilience against failures: the system continuously seeks to achieve and maintain the desired state. | Increased autonomy of engineering teams: each team is free to choose the tools and infrastructure that suit their needs. The reconciler framework only requires a minimal amount of coupling between controllers while still allowing one to write expressive workflows. | Battle tested patterns and tools: This reconciler based framework does not invent something new. Kubernetes has a rich ecosystem of tools that aim to make it easy to build controllers. The popularity of Kubernetes means there is a large and growing community familiar with this pattern and supporting tools. | . GitOps: Operation By Pull Request . GitOps, Figure 5, is a pattern for managing infrastructure. The core idea of GitOps is that source control (doesn’t have to be git) should be the source of truth for configuration files describing your infrastructure. Controllers can then monitor source control and automatically update your infrastructure as your config changes. This means to make a change (or undo a change) you just open a pull request. . . Figure 5: To push a new model for Label Bot we create a PR updating the config map storing the id of the Auto ML model we want to use. When the PR is merged, Anthos Config Management(ACM) automatically rolls out those changes to our GKE cluster. As a result, subsequent predictions are made using the new model. (Image courtesy of Weaveworks) Putting It Together: Reconciler + GitOps = CI/CD for ML . With that background out of the way, let’s dive into how we built CI/CD for ML by combining the Reconciler and GitOps patterns. . There were three problems we needed to solve: . How do we compute the diff between the desired and actual state of the world? | How do we affect the changes needed to make the actual state match the desired state? | How do we build a control loop to continuously run 1 &amp; 2? | Computing Diffs . To compute the diffs we just write lambdas that do exactly what we want. So in this case we wrote two lambdas: . The first lambda determines whether we need to retrain based on the age of the most recent model. | The second lambda determines whether the model needs to be updated by comparing the most recently trained model to the model listed in a config map checked into source control. | We wrap these lambdas in a simple web server and deploy on Kubernetes. One reason we chose this approach is because we wanted to rely on Kubernetes’ git-sync to mirror our repository to a pod volume. This makes our lambdas super simple because all the git management is taken care of by a side-car running git-sync. . Actuation . To apply the changes necessary, we use Tekton to glue together various CLIs that we use to perform the various steps. . Model Training . To train our model we have a Tekton task that: . Runs our notebook using papermill. | Converts the notebook to html using nbconvert. | Uploads the .ipynb and .html files to GCS using gsutil | This notebook fetches GitHub Issues data from BigQuery and generates CSV files on GCS suitable for import into Google AutoML. The notebook then launches an AutoML job to train a model. . We chose AutoML because we wanted to focus on building a complete end to end solution rather than iterating on the model. AutoML provides a competitive baseline that we may try to improve upon in the future. . To easily view the executed notebook we convert it to html and upload it to GCS which makes it easy to serve public, static content. This allows us to use notebooks to generate rich visualizations to evaluate our model. . Model Deployment . To deploy our model we have a Tekton task that: . Uses kpt to update our configmap with the desired value. | Runs git to push our changes to a branch. | Uses a wrapper around the GitHub CLI (gh) to create a PR. | The controller ensures there is only one Tekton pipeline running at a time. We configure our pipelines to always push to the same branch. This ensures we only ever open one PR to update the model because GitHub doesn’t allow multiple PRs to be created from the same branch. . Once the PR is merged Anthos Config Mesh automatically applies the Kubernetes manifests to our Kubernetes cluster. . Why Tekton . We picked Tekton because the primary challenge we faced was sequentially running a series of CLIs in various containers. Tekton is perfect for this. Importantly, all the steps in a Tekton task run on the same pod which allows data to be shared between steps using a pod volume. . Furthermore, since Tekton resources are Kubernetes resources we can adopt the same GitOps pattern and tooling to update our pipeline definitions. . The Control Loop . Finally, we needed to build a control loop that would periodically invoke our lambdas and launch our Tekton pipelines as needed. We used kubebuilder to create a simple custom controller. Our controller’s reconcile loop will call our lambda to determines whether a sync is needed and if so with what parameters. If a sync is needed the controller fires off a Tekton pipeline to perform the actual update. An example of our custom resource is illustrated below: . apiVersion: automl.cloudai.kubeflow.org/v1alpha1 kind: ModelSync metadata: name: modelsync-sample namespace: label-bot-prod spec: failedPipelineRunsHistoryLimit: 10 needsSyncUrl: http://labelbot-diff.label-bot-prod/needsSync parameters: - needsSyncName: name pipelineName: automl-model pipelineRunTemplate: spec: params: - name: automl-model value: notavlidmodel - name: branchName value: auto-update - name: fork value: git@github.com:kubeflow/code-intelligence.git - name: forkName value: fork pipelineRef: name: update-model-pr resources: - name: repo resourceSpec: params: - name: url value: https://github.com/kubeflow/code-intelligence.git - name: revision value: master type: git serviceAccountName: auto-update successfulPipelineRunsHistoryLimit: 10 . The custom resource specifies the endpoint, needsSyncUrl, for the lambda that computes whether a sync is needed and a Tekton PipelineRun, pipelineRunTemplate, describing the pipeline run to create when a sync is needed. The controller takes care of the details; e.g. ensuring only 1 pipeline per resource is running at a time, garbage collecting old runs, etc… All of the heavy lifting is taken care of for us by Kubernetes and kubebuilder. . Note, for historical reasons the kind, ModelSync, and apiVersion automl.cloudai.kubeflow.org are not reflective of what the controller actually does. We plan on fixing this in the future. . Build Your Own CI/CD pipelines . Our code base is a long way from being polished, easily reusable tooling. Nonetheless it is all public and could be a useful starting point for trying to build your own pipelines. . Here are some pointers to get you started: . Use the Dockerfile to build your own ModelSync controller | Modify the kustomize package to use your image and deploy the controller | Define one or more lambdas as needed for your use cases You can use our Lambda server as an example | We wrote ours in go but you can use any language and web framework you like (e.g. flask) | . | Define Tekton pipelines suitable for your use cases; our pipelines(linked below) might be a useful starting point Notebook Tekton task - Run notebook with papermill and upload to GCS | PR Tekton Task - Tekton task to open GitHub PRs | . | Define ModelSync resources for your use case; you can refer to ours as an example ModelSync Deploy Spec - YAML to continuously deploy label bot | ModelSync Train Spec - YAML to continuously train our model | . | If you’d like to see us clean it up and include it in a future Kubeflow release please chime in on issue kubeflow/kubeflow#5167. . What’s Next . Lineage Tracking . Since we do not have an explicit DAG representing the sequence of steps in our CI/CD pipeline understanding the lineage of our models can be challenging. Fortunately, Kubeflow Metadata solves this by making it easy for each step to record information about what outputs it produced using what code and inputs. Kubeflow metadata can easily recover and plot the lineage graph. The figure below shows an example of the lineage graph from our xgboost example. . . Figure 6: screenshot of the lineage tracking UI for our xgboost example. Our plan is to have our controller automatically write lineage tracking information to the metadata server so we can easily understand the lineage of what’s in production. . Conclusion . . Building ML products is a team effort. In order to move a model from a proof of concept to a shipped product, data scientists and devops engineers need to collaborate. To foster this collaboration, we believe it is important to allow data scientists and devops engineers to use their preferred tools. Concretely, we wanted to support the following tools for Data Scientists, Devops Engineers, and SREs: . Jupyter notebooks for developing models. | GitOps for continuous integration and deployment. | Kubernetes and managed cloud services for underlying infrastructure. | . To maximize each team’s autonomy and reduce dependencies on tools, our CI/CD process follows a decentralized approach. Rather than explicitly define a DAG that connects the steps, our approach relies on a series of controllers that can be defined and administered independently. We think this maps naturally to enterprises where responsibilities might be split across teams; a data engineering team might be responsible for turning weblogs into features, a modeling team might be responsible for producing models from the features, and a deployments team might be responsible for rolling those models into production. .

            "title": "Kubeflow & Kale simplify building better ML Pipelines with automatic hyperparameter tuning",
            "content": "Running pipelines at scale has never been easier. . Kubeflow’s Kale is maturing and fast becoming the superfood that glues together the main Kubeflow components to provide a cohesive and seamless data science experience. . TL;DR: Convert Notebook to Kubeflow Pipelines, run them as hyperparameter tuning experiments, track executions and artifacts with MLMD, cache and maintain an immutable history of executions: Kale brings all of this on the table in a unified workflow tool, simple to use. . Running pipelines at scale has never been easier . Kubeflow’s Kale is maturing and fast becoming the superfood that glues together the main Kubeflow components to provide a cohesive and seamless data science experience. With its newest release, Kale provides an end-to-end workflow that encompasses Jupyter Notebooks, Kubeflow Pipelines, hyperparameter tuning with Katib, metadata tracking with ML Metadata (MLMD), and faster pipeline executions with caching. . If you are new to Kale, head over to this short introduction to get started! . In this blog post, you will learn about the features that Kale is bringing to the Machine Learning community with version 0.5, and learn how to get started with a curated example. . New Face . First off, we are excited to reveal the new Kale logo. Kudos to Konstantinos Palaiologos (Arrikto) for designing the brand new, modern Kale leaf. This will be the new face of the project from now on. . . Hyperparameter Tuning . The major new addition in v0.5 is the support for running pipelines with Katib. Katib is Kubeflow’s component to run general purpose hyperparameter tuning jobs. Just as you would press a single button to convert a notebook to a pipeline, you can now press a button and let Kale start a hyperparameter Job on that pipeline. All you need to do is tell Kale what the HP tuning job should search for. . Running hyperparameter tuning jobs gives you a dramatic boost in delivering good results for your project. The *manual *tuning process of running your model countless times, using different parameters combinations, aggregating them and comparing them, is error-prone and inefficient. Delegating this work to an automated process allows you to become faster, more efficient and accurate. . Parametrize the HP tuning Job directly from the notebook . Katib does not know anything about the jobs that it is actually running (called Trials in the Katib jargon). Katib supports running Trials as simple Jobs (that is, Pods), BatchJobs, TFJobs, and PyTorchJobs. Kale 0.5 integrates Katib with Kubeflow Pipelines. This enables Katib trails to run as pipelines in KFP. The metrics from the pipeline runs are provided to help in model performance analysis and debugging. All Kale needs to know from the user is the search space, the optimization algorithm, and the search goal. . Kale will also make sure that all the runs of a Katib experiment, end up unified and grouped, under a single KFP experiment, to make it easy to search and isolate a particular job. . Kale will also show a live view of the running experiments, directly in the notebook, so you will know how many pipelines are still running and, upon completion, which one performed best. . New features . Pipeline parameters and metrics . In order to run pipelines with hyperparameter tuning, the pipeline needs to be able to accept arguments and produce metrics. Enabling the pipeline to do this, is now tremendously easy. Kale provides two new cell tags: pipeline-parameters and pipeline-metrics. . . Assigning the pipeline-parameters tag on any cell that contains some variables will instruct Kale to transform them to pipeline parameters. These values will then be passed to the pipeline steps that actually make use of them. . . If you want the pipeline to produce some metrics, just print them at the end of the notebook and assign the pipeline-metrics tag to the cell. Kale will take care of understanding which steps produce the metrics and you will see them appear in the KFP dashboard. . Rich notebook outputs . Having your pipelines produce rich outputs (like plots, tables, metrics, …) that can be captured and displayed by the Kubeflow Pipelines dashboard has always been somewhat cumbersome. You would need to write some KFP-specific code to produce json artifacts that would then be interpreted by KFP. . What if you could just write plain Python in your Notebook using your favourite plotting library, and have the plots auto-magically appear as KFP outputs, when the Notebook gets compiled into a pipeline? . Now, when running your notebook code inside a pipeline step, Kale will wrap it and feed it to an ipython kernel, so that all the nice artifacts produced in the notebook, will be produced in the pipeline as well. Kale will capture all these rich outputs automatically and instruct KFP to display them in the dashboard. Effectively, whatever happens in the notebook, now happens in the pipeline as well. The execution context is exactly the same. . Any rich output that is visible in the notebook gets captured by Kale and exposed in the KFP dashboard. . MLMD Integration . An important part of running reproducible Machine Learning collaboratively and at scale, is being able to track pipeline executions, their inputs, their outputs and how these are connected together. Kubeflow provides an ML Metadata service which serves this exact purpose. This service also includes a lineage view to enable the user to have a deep insight into the whole history of events. . Kale is now fully integrated with this service, logging each new execution automatically alongside all the artifacts produced by the pipeline. . Run on GPU . If you need to run a particular step on a GPU node, Kale has you covered too. You can now annotate steps with a dedicated dialog, directly from the notebook and each step can have its own annotations. This is just the first iteration, Kale will support adding any kind of K8s limits or annotations to pipeline steps in the near future. . . Overall UI and performance improvements . The new version of Kale’s JupyterLab brings tons of performance improvements and UI enhancements. Updating the notebook cells’ annotations will now be easier and faster. We covered many corner cases and solved tons of bugs. The UI of the cell’s annotation editor is more consistent with the overall Jupyter style and much more intuitive and easy to use. A big shoutout to Tasos Alexiou (Arrikto) for having spent countless hours in understanding the Jupyter internals and improving our application lifecycle. . Hands-On . To start playing-around with Kale v0.5, head over to the GitHub repository and follow the installation instructions. If you are already running Kubeflow (either in your own cluster or on MiniKF), spin up a new Notebook Server using the image gcr.io/arrikto/jupyter-kale:v0.5.0. . Note: Kale v0.5 needs to run on Kubeflow ≥ 1.0. Also, make sure that the following Kubeflow components are updated as follows: . Katib controller: gcr.io/arrikto/katib-controller:40b5b51a . | Katib Chocolate service: gcr.io/arrikto/suggestion-chocolate:40b5b51a . | . We will release a new version of MiniKF very soon, containing a lot of improvements that will make the Kale experience even better. You will also be able to go through a new Codelab to try out the Kale-Katib integration yourself. Stay tuned for updates on the Arrikto channels. . Road Ahead . We are always looking to improve Kale and help data scientists have a seamless ML workflow from writing code to training, optimizing, and serving their models. . We are excited to have the ML community try out this new version of Kale and the coming MiniKF update. . A special mention must go to the various members of the Arrikto team (Ilias Katsakioris, Chris Pavlou, Kostis Lolos, Tasos Alexiou) who contributed to delivering all these new features. .",

            "title": "Introduction to Kubeflow MPI Operator and Industry Adoption",
            "content": "Kubeflow just announced its first major 1.0 release recently, which makes it easy for machine learning engineers and data scientists to leverage cloud assets (public or on-premise) for machine learning workloads. In this post, we’d like to introduce MPI Operator (docs), one of the core components of Kubeflow, currently in alpha, which makes it easy to run synchronized, allreduce-style distributed training on Kubernetes. . There are two major distributed training strategies nowadays: one based on parameter servers and the other based on collective communication primitives such as allreduce. . Parameter server based distribution strategy relies on centralized parameter servers for coordination between workers, responsible for collecting gradients from workers and sending updated parameters to workers. The diagram below shows the interaction between parameter servers and worker nodes under this distributed training strategy. . . While distributed training based on parameter servers can support training very large models and datasets by adding more workers and parameter servers, there are additional challenges involved in order to optimize the performance: . It is not easy to identify the right ratio of the number of workers to the number of parameter servers. For example, if only a small number of parameter servers are used, network communication will likely become the bottleneck for training. . | If many parameter servers are used, the communication may saturate network interconnects. . | The memory quota of workers and parameter servers requires fine tuning to avoid out-of-memory errors or memory waste. . | If the model could fit within the computational resources of each worker, additional maintenance and communication overheads are introduced when the model is partitioned to multiple parameter servers. . | We need to replicate the model on each parameter server in order to support fault-tolerance, which requires additional computational and storage resources. . | . In contrast, distributed training based on collective communication primitives such as allreduce could be more efficient and easier to use in certain use cases. Under allreduce-based distributed training strategy, each worker stores a complete set of model parameters. In other words, no parameter server is needed. Allreduce-based distributed training could address many of the challenges mentioned above: . Each worker stores a complete set of model parameters, no parameter server is needed, so it’s straightforward to add more workers when necessary. . | Failures among the workers can be recovered easily by restarting the failed workers and then load the current model from any of the existing workers. Model does not need to be replicated to support fault-tolerance. . | The model can be updated more efficiently by fully leveraging the network structure and collective communication algorithms. For example, in ring-allreduce algorithm, each of the N workers only needs to communicate with two of its peer workers 2 * (N − 1) times to update all the model parameters completely. . | Scaling up and down the number of workers is as easy as reconstructing the underlying allreduce communicator and re-assigning the ranks among the workers. . | . There are many existing technologies available that provide implementations for these collective communication primitives such as NCCL, Gloo, and many different implementations of MPI. . MPI Operator provides a common Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for defining a training job on a single CPU/GPU, multiple CPU/GPUs, and multiple nodes. It also implements a custom controller to manage the CRD, create dependent resources, and reconcile the desired states. . . Unlike other operators in Kubeflow such as TF Operator and PyTorch Operator that only supports for one machine learning framework, MPI operator is decoupled from underlying framework so it can work well with many frameworks such as Horovod, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Apache MXNet, and various collective communication implementations such as OpenMPI. . For more details on comparisons between different distributed training strategies, various Kubeflow operators, please check out our presentation at KubeCon Europe 2019. . Example API Spec . We’ve been working closely with the community and industry adopters to improve the API spec for MPI Operator so it’s suitable for many different use cases. Below is an example: . apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v1alpha2 kind: MPIJob metadata: name: tensorflow-benchmarks spec: slotsPerWorker: 1 cleanPodPolicy: Running mpiReplicaSpecs: Launcher: replicas: 1 template: spec: containers: - image: mpioperator/tensorflow-benchmarks:latest name: tensorflow-benchmarks command: - mpirun - python - scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks/tf_cnn_benchmarks.py - --model=resnet101 - --batch_size=64 - --variable_update=horovod Worker: replicas: 2 template: spec: containers: - image: mpioperator/tensorflow-benchmarks:latest name: tensorflow-benchmarks resources: limits: nvidia.com/gpu: 1 . Note that MPI Operator provides a flexible but user-friendly API that’s consistent across other Kubeflow operators. . Users can easily customize their launcher and worker pod specs by modifying the relevant sections in the template. For example, customizing to use various types of computational resources such as CPUs, GPUs, memory, etc. . In addition, below is an example spec that performs distributed TensorFlow training job using ImageNet data in TFRecords format stored in a Kubernetes volume: . apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v1alpha2 kind: MPIJob metadata: name: tensorflow-benchmarks spec: slotsPerWorker: 1 cleanPodPolicy: Running mpiReplicaSpecs: Launcher: replicas: 1 template: spec: containers: - image: mpioperator/tensorflow-benchmarks:latest name: tensorflow-benchmarks command: - mpirun - python - scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks/tf_cnn_benchmarks.py - --model=resnet101 - --batch_size=64 - --variable_update=horovod Worker: replicas: 2 template: spec: containers: - image: mpioperator/tensorflow-benchmarks:latest name: tensorflow-benchmarks resources: limits: nvidia.com/gpu: 1 . Architecture . MPI Operator contains a custom controller that listens for changes in MPIJob resources. When a new MPIJob is created, the controller goes through the following logical steps: . Create a ConfigMap that contains: | A helper shell script that can be used by mpirun in place of ssh. It invokes kubectl exec for remote execution. . | A hostfile that lists the pods in the worker StatefulSet (in the form of ${job-id}-worker-0, ${job-id}-worker-1, …), and the available slots (CPUs/GPUs) in each pod. . | . Create the RBAC resources (Role, ServiceAccount, RoleBinding) to allow remote execution (pods/exec). . | Wait for the worker pods to be ready. . | Create the launcher job. It runs under the ServiceAccount created in step 2, and sets up the necessary environment variables for executing mpirun commands remotely. The kubectl binary is delivered to an emptyDir volume through an init container. . | After the launcher job finishes, set the replicas to 0 in the worker StatefulSet. . | . For more details, please check out the design doc for MPI Operator. . Industry Adoption . At the time of writing, there are 13 disclosed industry adopters and many others who’ve been working closely with the community to reach where we are today. We’d like to showcase some of the use cases of MPI Operator in several companies. If your company would like to be included in the list of adopters, please send us a pull request on GitHub! . Ant Group . At Ant Group, we manage Kubernetes clusters with tens of thousands of nodes and have deployed the MPI Operator along with other Kubeflow operators. The MPI Operator leverages the network structure and collective communication algorithms so that users don’t have to worry about the right ratio between the number of workers and parameter servers to obtain the best performance. Users can focus on building out their model architectures without spending time on tuning the downstream infrastructure for distributed training. . The models produced have been widely deployed in production and battle-tested in many different real life scenarios. One notable use case is Saofu — a mobile app for users to scan any “福” (Chinese character that represents fortune) through augmented reality to enter a lucky draw where each user would receive a virtual red envelope with a portion of a significant amount of money. . Bloomberg . Bloomberg, the global business and financial information and news leader, possesses an enormous amount of data — from historical news to real-time market data and everything in between. Bloomberg’s Data Science Platform was built to allow the company’s internal machine learning engineers and data scientists to more easily leverage data and algorithmic models in their daily work, including when training jobs and automatic machine learning models used in the state-of-the-art solutions they’re building. . “The Data Science Platform at Bloomberg offers a TensorFlowJob CRD similar to Kubeflow’s own TFJob, enabling the company’s data scientists to easily train neural network models. Recently, the Data Science Platform team enabled Horovod-based distributed training in its TensorFlowJob via the MPI Operator as an implementation detail. Using MPIJob in the back-end has allowed the Bloomberg Data Science Platform team to quickly offer its machine learning engineers a robust way to train a BERT model within hours using the company’s large corpus of text data’’, says Chengjian Zheng, software engineer from Bloomberg. . Caicloud . Caicloud Clever is an artificial intelligence cloud platform based on Caicloud container cloud platform with powerful hardware resource management and efficient model development capabilities. Caicloud products have been deployed in many 500 China Fortune companies. . “Caicloud Clever supports multiple frameworks of AI model training including TensorFlow, Apache MXNet, Caffe, PyTorch with the help of Kubeflow tf-operator, pytorch-operator and others”, says Ce Gao, AI infrastructure engineer from Caicloud Clever team. “While RingAllReduce distributed training support is requested for improved customer maturity.” . Kubeflow MPI operator is a Kubernetes Operator for allreduce-style distributed training. Caicloud Clever team adopts MPI Operator’s v1alpha2 API. The Kubernetes native API makes it easy to work with the existing systems in the platform. . Iguazio . Iguazio provides a cloud-native data science platform with emphasis on automation, performance, scalability, and use of open-source tools. . According to Yaron Haviv, the Founder and CTO of Iguazio, “We evaluated various mechanisms which will allow us to scale deep learning frameworks with minimal developer effort and found that using the combination of Horovod with the MPI Operator over Kubernetes is the best tool for the job since it enable horizontal scalability, supports multiple frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch and doesn’t require too much extra coding or the complex use of parameter servers.” . Iguazio have integrated the MPI Operator into its managed service offering and its fast data layer for maximum scalability, and work to simplify the usage through open source projects like MLRun (for ML automation and tracking). Check out this blog post with an example application that demonstrates Iguazio’s usage of the MPI Operator. . Polyaxon . Polyaxon is a platform for reproducible and scalable machine learning on Kubernetes, it allows users to iterate faster on their research and model creation. Polyaxon provides a simple abstraction for data scientists and machine learning engineers to streamline their experimentation workflow, and provides a very cohesive abstraction for training and tracking models using popular frameworks such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Apache MXNet, Caffe, etc. . “Several Polyaxon users and customers were requesting an easy way to perform an allreduce-style distributed training, the MPI Operator was the perfect solution to provide such abstraction. Polyaxon is deployed at several companies and research institutions, and the public docker hub has over 9 million downloads.”, says Mourad Mourafiq, the Co-founder of Polyxagon. . Community and Call for Contributions . We are grateful for over 28 individual contributors from over 11 organizations, namely Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Ant Group, Bloomberg, Caicloud, Google Cloud, Huawei, Iguazio, NVIDIA, Polyaxon, and Tencent, that have contributed directly to MPI Operator’s codebase and many others who’ve filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and answered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions.

            "title": "Kubeflow 1.0 - Cloud Native ML for Everyone",
            "content": "Kubeflow 1.0: Cloud Native ML for Everyone . On behalf of the entire community, we are proud to announce Kubeflow 1.0, our first major release. Kubeflow was open sourced at Kubecon USA in December 2017, and during the last two years the Kubeflow Project has grown beyond our wildest expectations. There are now hundreds of contributors from over 30 participating organizations. . Kubeflow’s goal is to make it easy for machine learning (ML) engineers and data scientists to leverage cloud assets (public or on-premise) for ML workloads. You can use Kubeflow on any Kubernetes-conformant cluster. . With 1.0, we are graduating a core set of stable applications needed to develop, build, train, and deploy models on Kubernetes efficiently. (Read more in Kubeflow’s versioning policies and application requirements for graduation.) . Graduating applications include: . Kubeflow’s UI, the central dashboard . | Jupyter notebook controller and web app . | Tensorflow Operator (TFJob) and PyTorch Operator for distributed training . | kfctl for deployment and upgrades . | Profile controller and UI for multiuser management . | . Hear more about Kubeflow’s mission and 1.0 release in this interview with Kubeflow founder and core contributor Jeremy Lewi on the Kubernetes Podcast. . Develop, Build, Train, and Deploy with Kubeflow . Kubeflow’s 1.0 applications that make up our develop, build, train, deploy critical user journey. . With Kubeflow 1.0, users can use Jupyter to develop models. They can then use Kubeflow tools like fairing (Kubeflow’s python SDK) to build containers and create Kubernetes resources to train their models. Once they have a model, they can use KFServing to create and deploy a server for inference. . Getting Started with ML on Kubernetes . Kubernetes is an amazing platform for leveraging infrastructure (whether on public cloud or on-premises), but deploying Kubernetes optimized for ML and integrated with your cloud is no easy task. With 1.0 we are providing a CLI and configuration files so you can deploy Kubeflow with one command: . kfctl apply -f [kfctl_gcp_iap.v1.0.0.yaml](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/master/kfdef/kfctl_gcp_iap.yaml) kfctl apply -f [kfctl_k8s_istio.v1.0.0.yaml](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/master/kfdef/kfctl_gcp_iap.yaml) kfctl apply -f [kfctl_aws_cognito.v1.0.0.yaml](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/master/kfdef/kfctl_gcp_iap.yaml) kfctl apply -f [kfctl_ibm.v1.0.0.yaml](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/master/kfdef/kfctl_gcp_iap.yaml) . Jupyter on Kubernetes . In Kubeflow’s user surveys, data scientists have consistently expressed the importance of Jupyter notebooks. Further, they need the ability to integrate isolated Jupyter notebooks with the efficiencies of Kubernetes on Cloud to train larger models using GPUs and run multiple experiments in parallel. Kubeflow makes it easy to leverage Kubernetes for resource management and put the full power of your datacenter at the fingertips of your data scientist. . With Kubeflow, each data scientist or team can be given their own namespace in which to run their workloads. Namespaces provide security and resource isolation. Using Kubernetes resource quotas, platform administrators can easily limit how much resources an individual or team can consume to ensure fair scheduling. . After deploying Kubeflow, users can leverage Kubeflow’s central dashboard for launching notebooks: . Kubeflow’s UI for managing notebooks: view and connect to existing notebooks or launch a new one. . In the Kubeflow UI users can easily launch new notebooks by choosing one of the pre-built docker images for Jupyter or entering the URL of a custom image. Next, users can set how many CPUs and GPUs to attach to their notebook. Notebooks can also include configuration and secrets parameters which simplify access to external repositories and databases. . . Training faster with distributed training . Distributed training is the norm at Google (blog), and one of the most exciting and requested features for deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. . When we started Kubeflow, one of our key motivations was to leverage Kubernetes to simplify distributed training. Kubeflow provides Kubernetes custom resources that make distributed training with TensorFlow and PyTorch simple. All a user needs to do is define a TFJob or PyTorch resource like the one illustrated below. The custom controller takes care of spinning up and managing all of the individual processes and configuring them to talk to one another: . apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v1 kind: TFJob metadata: name: mnist-train spec: tfReplicaSpecs: Chief: replicas: 1 spec: containers: image: gcr.io/alice-dev/fairing-job/mnist name: tensorflow Ps: replicas: 1 template: spec: containers: image: gcr.io/alice-dev/fairing-job/mnist name: tensorflow Worker: replicas: 10 spec: containers: image: gcr.io/alice-dev/fairing-job/mnist name: tensorflow . Monitoring Model Training With TensorBoard . To train high quality models, data scientists need to debug and monitor the training process with tools like Tensorboard. With Kubernetes and Kubeflow, userscan easily deploy TensorBoard on their Kubernetes cluster by creating YAML files like the ones below. When deploying TensorBoard on Kubeflow, users can take advantage of Kubeflow’s AuthN and AuthZ integration to securely access TensorBoard behind Kubeflow’s ingress on public clouds: . // On GCP: [https://${KFNAME}.endpoints.${PROJECT}.cloud.goog/mnist/kubeflow-mnist/tensorboard/](https://${KFNAME}.endpoints.${PROJECT}.cloud.goog/mnist/kubeflow-mnist/tensorboard/) // On AWS: [http://8fb34ebe-istiosystem-istio-2af2-925939634.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/mnist/anonymous/tensorboard/](http://8fb34ebe-istiosystem-istio-2af2-925939634.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/mnist/anonymous/tensorboard/) . No need to kubectl port-forward to individual pods. . Deploying Models . KFServing is a custom resource built on top of Knative for deploying and managing ML models. KFServing offers the following capabilities not provided by lower level primitives (e.g. Deployment): . Deploy your model using out-of-the-box model servers (no need to write your own flask app) . | Auto-scaling based on load, even for models served on GPUs . | Safe, controlled model rollout . | Explainability (alpha) . | Payload logging (alpha) . | Below is an example of a KFServing spec showing how a model can be deployed. All a user has to do is provide the URI of their model file using storageUri: . apiVersion: &quot;serving.kubeflow.org/v1alpha2&quot; kind: &quot;InferenceService&quot; metadata: name: &quot;sklearn-iris&quot; spec: default: predictor: sklearn: storageUri: &quot;gs://kfserving-samples/models/sklearn/iris&quot; . Check out the samples to learn how to use the above capabilities. . Solutions are More Than Models . A model gathering dust in object storage isn’t doing your organization any good. To put ML to work, you typically need to incorporate that model into an application – whether it’s a web application, mobile app, or part of some backend reporting pipeline. . Frameworks like flask and bootstrap make it easy for data scientists to create rich, visually appealing web applications that put their models to work. Below is a screenshot of the UI we built for Kubeflow’s mnist example. . With Kubeflow, there is no need for data scientists to learn new concepts or platforms to deploy their applications, or to deal with ingress, networking certificates, etc. They can deploy their application just like TensorBoard; the only thing that changes is the Docker image and flags. . . If this sounds like just what you are looking for we recommend: . Visiting our docs to learn how to deploy Kubeflow on your public or private cloud. . | Walking through the mnist tutorial to try our core applications yourself. . | What’s coming in Kubeflow . There’s much more to Kubeflow than what we’ve covered in this blog post. In addition to the applications listed here, we have a number of applications under development: . Pipelines (beta) for defining complex ML workflows . | Metadata (beta) for tracking datasets, jobs, and models, . | Katib (beta) for hyper-parameter tuning . | Distributed operators for other frameworks like xgboost . | . In future releases we will be graduating these applications to 1.0. . User testimonials . All this would be nothing without feedback from and collaboration with our users. Some feedback from people using Kubeflow in production include: . *“The Kubeflow 1.0 release is a significant milestone as it positions Kubeflow to be a viable ML Enterprise platform. Kubeflow 1.0 delivers material productivity enhancements for ML researchers.” — *Jeff Fogarty, AVP ML / Cloud Engineer, US Bank . *“Kubeflow’s data and model storage allows for smooth integration into CI/CD processes, allowing for a much faster and more agile delivery of machine learning models into applications.” — *Laura Schornack, **Shared Services Architect, Chase Commercial Bank** . *“With the launch of Kubeflow 1.0 we now have a feature complete end-to-end open source machine learning platform, allowing everyone from small teams to large unicorns like Gojek to run ML at scale.” — *Willem Pienaar, Engineering Lead, Data Science Platform, GoJek . *“Kubeflow provides a seamless interface to a great set of tools that together manages the complexity of ML workflows and encourages best practices.
