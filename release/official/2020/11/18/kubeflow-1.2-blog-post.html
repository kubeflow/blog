    <h2 id="special-message-from-kubeflow-founders">Special Message from Kubeflow Founders</h2>

<p>Three years (!!) ago, we (Jeremy Lewi, Vish Kannan and David Aronchick) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3dVF5wWz-g">stood on stage at Kubecon</a> to introduce Kubeflow for the first time. We could not have possibly imagined what would have come about - thousands of GitHub stars, tens of thousands of commits and a community that has built the most flexible and scalable platform for machine learning. And, best of all, it’s not backed by an enormous company that requires you to “upgrade” in order to use it; we gave it all away for free! Here’s to everything you all have done and we could not be more excited about the NEXT three years (and the three years beyond that). Thank you!</p>

<h2 id="announcing-kubeflow-v12-release">Announcing Kubeflow v1.2 release</h2>

<p>The Kubeflow Community’s delivery of the Kubeflow 1.2 software release includes ~100 user requested enhancements to improve model building, training, tuning, ML pipelining and serving.  This post includes a Release Highlights Section, which details significant 1.2 features as contributed by the Kubeflow application working groups (WG), SIGs, and ecosystem partners.  The Kubeflow 1.2 <a href="https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/releases/tag/v1.2-rc.0">changelog</a> provides a quick view of the 1.2 deliveries.</p>

<p>The Release was validated, tested and documented by the developers, and the Release is now being validated, tested and documented by users, cloud providers and commercial support partners on popular platforms i.e. AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM, etc.   The Community is working on a more sustainable approach to owning and maintaining test infrastructure.</p>

<p>For Release 1.2, AWS has built and contributed a shared test-infra, which provides WG owners with enough permissions to identify problems, and test proposed solutions to completion. Currently, most WGs (AutoML, Training-Operators, KFServing, Deployments, Manifests) have already migrated their tests on this solution. As a result, the test-infra blocking time has fallen significantly, which is good for users and contributors.</p>

<h2 id="getting-involved">Getting Involved</h2>

<p>The Community continues to grow and we invite new users and contributors to join the Working Groups and Community Meetings. The following provides some helpful links to those looking to get involved with the Kubeflow Community:</p>

<ul>
